421,I definitely ate the cake section I cut out for the wall of legos üòâ,1,1541965144,2018-11-11
422,"Make sure to let the macarons rest long enough after piping them, before putting them into the oven. You can under-rest them, but you can't really over-rest them. Let them sit for an hour even if the recipe calls for 30 minutes since their humidity/temperature may be different from yours.

Make sure to scrape at the bottom of the bowl when incorporating the sifted dry mix into the meringue. The dry mix finds ways to sink to the bottom when folding.

I recommend watching several videos to gst an idea of the expected consistency of everything at every step. This is one of those things where text recipes/descriptions have a hard time capturing what is right, and where simply relying on things as written won't always be helpful (eg. It is important not to overfold or underfold, but it's a fine line to hit).

Take meticulous notes of how long you mix the meringue, how many folds you do, the temperature, etc. This is so that you have an idea of where to start troubleshooting if things go wrong.

This is a very good beginner's recipe https://michellesmacarons.com/french-macaron-recipe/ always weigh ingredients, sift well, and age your egg whites at least overnight. Letting the finished macarons mature for a day in the fridge also makes a big difference.",1,1541965498,2018-11-11

Fortunately, with all the videos out there, it's a lot easier to get started and nail things faster than before.

It takes practice to nail confidently, but anyome willing to invest the time can do it!

5,"I always use American buttercream. I use it for piping and frosting cakes and cupcakes. Works every time! I don't usually refrigerate buttercream. I use it after making it. In my opinion, I don't like cold buttercream because it will be harder to frost.

Swiss meringue buttercream is a good choice as well. It's not so ""buttery"" compared to American buttercream. But, SMB tend to curdle when butter is mixed in. You just have to mix it more to come together. If it still won't work, you can chill it for awhile and mix it again.

Both buttercreams are perfect for piping!

132,"In the US the only stigma I've seen time and time again is that women prefer to bake over men. That it is a more feminine thing to do. Like, if you baked your coworker a cake and you're male, it could lead to comments on your sexual orientation or more possibly your 'level' of masculinity. 

It's often seen when girls get toy baking sets and boys get toy tool kits. 

Hilariously enough, in many fields where there is the assumption that it is feminine in nature, you'll often see men dominating the highest paying positions in those fields. 

For a long time women weren't allowed to participate in careers. A lot of the assumption women loved baking probably came from the things they did being predominantly housewives. When you're home all day the only thing you can do is make a killer pecan pie. It's the only way to confirm yourself as an asset when you're not allowed other means of affirmation. 

I really do wish you the best though. I'm sure local bakeries are a different ball game, especially depending on what your local consists of. People carry these prejudices assuming they are built in to society. That you're the strange guy for wanting to bake with the ladies all day. 
But fuck that webbing man, you're not a fly! Don't let the spiders in society's psychological closet inhibit you from being anyone either than your best, happiest self. I live in a place where the men fix cars and the women make cakes. It's all a construct older than most of us and we don't have to adhere to it. 

Stay strong in your pursuits and good luck.",2,1539346047,2018-10-12

2/3 cup or 70g flour

1/2 cup or 70g shelled, unsalted pistachios

1/2 tsp baking powder

1/8 tsp salt

3 tbsp or 42g butter, room temperature

3 tbsp or 35g sugar

1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)

1/4 tsp orange blossom water  (I used fiori d'arancio, which is a strong Italian orange blossom water.  If you use a more commercially available orange blossom water you might want to add more to get the flavour to come through. )

1 egg yolk

Italian S Cookies:

NOTE: If the hive looks a bit too squashy, you can make 1.5x the S-cookie recipe to get more rings and therefore a taller hive!

2 2/3 cups or 333g all purpose flour

1 1/2 tsp baking powder

1/8 tsp salt

3 eggs, divided, at room temperature

1/2 cup or 100g honey powder (available at the Korean grocery 
store H-Mart, can substitute with granulated sugar if unavailable)

100 ml or 84g grapeseed oil (or a neutral tasting oil)

1 tsp vanilla extract 

1/2 tsp orange blossom water (I used fiori d'arancio, which is a strong Italian orange blossom water.  If you use a more commercially available orange blossom water you might want to add more to get the flavour to come through. )

1/8 tsp or a few drops of orange oil (or some orange zest)
black gel food colouring
1 tsp milk (for egg wash)

Orange-Cardamom Bee Wing Florentines:

1 scant cup or 73g blanched almonds, slivered

2 tbsp or 13g flour

1/2 tsp ground cardamom

1/4 cup or 37g honey powder (can substitute with granulated sugar)

2 tbsp or 27g butter

1 tbsp or 14g 35% cream

1 tbsp or 16g honey

2 tsp orange zest (from about 1 orange)

1/4 tsp vanilla extract (optional)

Vanilla Glaze:

(or use your favorite glaze or icing recipe)

1/2 cup or 100g icing sugar, sifted

1 1/2 tsp or ¬Ω tablespoon milk

1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Honey Caramel:

1/2 cup or 100g granulated white sugar

3 tbsp or 56g honey 

4 tsp or 1 to 2 tablespoons of water

1/3 cup or 80g heavy cream, room temperature

2 tbsp or 28g butter

1/8 tsp salt

Hard Caramel:

1/2 cup sugar

2 tbsp water

1 tsp corn syrup

Decorations:

gold lustre dust (for the gold crown)

Scant 1 tsp vodka (for dissolving the lustre dust to make gold paint, can substitute with any light coloured alcohol)

A few decorative gold drag√©es (for decorating the biscotti flowers)

black edible fine tip marker (for the bee faces)

red edible fine tip marker (for the Queen bee‚Äôs red lips)

---

Preparation

Cut two pieces of parchment paper to fit two rimmed baking sheets. Draw two 5 1/2-inch circles, three 3 1/2-inch circles and one 2 1/2-inch circle on backsides of sheets. Flip sheets over and line baking sheets with parchment. Line another two rimmed baking sheets with parchment.

For the pistachio-orange biscotti flowers:

Pulse together flour, pistachios, baking powder and salt in the bowl of a food processor until the mixture resembles a course meal.

In a medium bowl, cream together butter, sugar, vanilla and orange blossom water. Add egg yolk until blended. Add flour mixture and mix to combine.  The dough may be sticky. Place dough on a sheet of lightly floured parchment or Silpat, press into a disc, dust lightly with flour, cover it with another piece of parchment, and roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Keep the dough covered and chill for 1 hour (it will make the dough easier to cut with cookie cutter). 

Use a flower-shaped cookie cutter or fondant cutter and cut the cold dough into flower shapes and place on one prepared baking sheet.  Freeze for about 10 minutes. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes (check every minute after 10 minutes, flowers can burn quickly). Set aside to cool completely and pipe with vanilla glaze (see below).

For Italian S cookies:

Heat oven to 350 F. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk together 2 eggs and 1 egg white on medium-high. (Reserve the egg yolk for egg wash.) Slowly add honey powder, whisking until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.

Add the oil, vanilla, orange blossom water and orange oil (or zest) to egg mixture and mix to combined. Remove bowl from stand mixer and stir in flour mixture to create a soft dough.  Do not overmix, dough will be soft.

Reserve one quarter of the dough.

On a lightly-floured surface, roll remaining dough into scant 1/2-inch rope (cut dough into sections if it makes it easier.) Cut and place on the parchment paper guides:

two sections to fit inside the 5 1/2-inch circles

two to fit outside the 3 1/2-inch circles

one to fit inside the 3 1/2-inch circle

Cut 1-inch from two largest and one medium circle (these gaps will act as the door to the hive). Roll cut dough into a round and press to fill the 2 1/2-inch round on parchment guide (this will be the roof of the hive).

Reserve another one quarter of the reserved dough (for the bee's black stripes). Roll remaining dough into four to six 1-inch ovals (these will become the bees) and one 1 1/2-inch oval (this will become the queen bee).

Colour reserved dough with black food colouring and roll to scant 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 1/8-inch strips and wrap 2 to 3 strips completely around the oval to resemble bee stripes. Place on prepared sheet. Mix reserved yolk with milk and brush rounds and bees with egg wash.

Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, about 15 to 17 minutes.
Optional: During last minute of baking switch to broil (the tops will become slightly golden in color).

For the bee wing florentines:

Heat oven to 325 F.

Place almonds, flour and cardamom into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir the honey powder, butter, cream and honey together until honey powder is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract and orange zest. Add the almond mixture and stir until incorporated. Cool 5 minutes.

On one prepared baking sheet, spoon out generous teaspoons of warm batter 2 inches apart.  Flatten slightly with a dampened palm.

Bake 7 to 10 minutes, just until the edges start to darken and brown.  Keep a close eye on them since they can burn easily. While cookies are still warm and flexible, use a 2-inch cookie cutter to cut a circle from each cookie. Use a slightly larger than 2‚Äù to cut a larger circle (for the Queen's wings). Cut each round in half.  You will end up with many extra wings than you need, which is good because the wings are very delicate and you will bound to break a few when adhering to bee bodies.

Use one cookie to cut out a crown shape for the queen bee.

Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.  Once cooled these cookies should be crisp.  If they‚Äôre not crisp, put them back in the oven for a couple more minutes.

For vanilla glaze (for biscotti flowers):

In a small bowl, whisk together icing sugar, milk and vanilla. Spoon into a small piping bag fitted with a writing tip and pipe decorative lines onto cookies.

Press gold drag√©es into middle of flowers. Set aside to dry.

For the honey caramel:

Heat the sugar, honey and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and simmer until golden, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the butter and cream and stir to combine.

Continue to cook until a candy thermometer reads 246 F. Remove from heat and stir in salt.

Working quickly, spoon some caramel onto bottom of the 2nd largest S-cookie ring with an opening. Press onto serving platter.

Spoon caramel onto the ring on the serving platter, then press one of the largest rings lightly to adhere on top. Repeat with another large ring, then with second largest ring, then smallest ring. Top with 2 1/2-inch round. Spoon any remaining honey caramel into a small serving dish to serve with sculpture (or freeze the leftovers for another project).

To decorate:

Mix luster dust with vodka to make a thin paste. Carefully brush bee wings and crown gold.  Draw faces on bee bodies with black and red edible markers.

For hard caramel:

Combine sugar, water and corn syrup in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Without stirring, bring to a boil and simmer until a candy thermometer reads 300 F or when mixture turns light amber.

Plunge bottom of pot into cold water.

Working quickly, attach wings and crown to bees by spooning a small amount of hard caramel to bee and pressing wings lightly to adhere. Spread base of bees and flowers with caramel and attach to beehive, pressing to adhere.  Be very careful not to burn your finger tips!",3,1539352484,2018-10-12

178,"Literally everything I've baked during the last few weeks has been pumpkin and I needed a break from it. I still wanted something that was autumn-themed and I had a bag of Reese's Pieces in the pantry. These cookies fit the bill. I looked for a recipe with a smaller amount of peanut butter in the dough because I wanted only a mild, not overwhelming PB flavor. 

I used [this recipe from King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/chocolate-peanut-butter-cookies-recipe) with some tweaks. Obviously I used Reese's Pieces instead of mini peanut butter cups. I replaced the granulated sugar with more brown sugar to get a chewier cookie, used cream instead of water, and added 1/2 teaspoon of espresso powder. I used shortening instead of butter because I usually have problems with my chocolate cookies spreading too much, but as you can see these did not. I should have pressed down the dough balls a little bit before baking. Regardless of the shape, they are very tasty!",1,1539355601,2018-10-12

191,"I'm barely starting down the road to home baking so idk how much help I will be. The first step is to determine the cottage baking laws for your area. Some are very liberal, some will require an inspection and a separate fridge/freezer, etc. You will also not be able to make ""potentially hazardous foods"" (meringue, hot canned preserves, anything dealing with raw foods or the possibility of bacteria growth). 

You may also be required to get a business license, you'll need to check with the city/county you live in. Thats the bare bones basics of logistics. 

As far as customers, I'm just starting down that road myself so I cant help much. I've made a Facebook page with galleries of all my works, and had some business cards printed up. I am providing free breakfast treats to vendors at a craft show tomorrow (my aunt runs it) so I'm hoping that might get me some interest.

You want to know ahead of time what items you will be offering. Cost out your recipes, and be sure to include your labor as well. I figured a 50% markup on my costs and labor. Dont be tempted to cheap out to get customers. Luckily i have a job already ( sounds like you do too) so I'm not going to sell myaelf short. My ultimate dream is to leverage my business into a brick and mortar store someday, so from the start I want to be known for quality bake goods worth the price, and to be paid what I'm worth.

U also need to adjust temp after a certain time.  Some people suggest.  But the main thing I am thinking is your macaronage stage.  The actual folding technique that makes the macrons difficult. That is where I would work on first then go to temps.  Your feet looks great that is hard for most.  Your shells don‚Äôt look shiny in the picture but they should be shiny.

2 1/2 cups flour
2 tbs sugar
2 sticks of butter
1 tsp salt
4-8tbs ice water

Mix sugar and salt into the flour in a large bowl. Finely dice 2 sticks of cold butter and drop into flour. Mix with a mixer or by hand until you get a very crumbly mixture similar in texture to potting soil. Add in 2 tbs cold water at a time until dough begins to form larger clumps. If you pinch it and it stays together its ready. Chill at least 1 hour before rolling out. Makes a top and bottom crust. 

Peach filling- 
2 cans of harvest spice flavored peaches sliced.
1/2 cup brown sugar
Juice from 2 small lemons
3-4 tbs of honey
1 tbs ground cinnamon
1 tbs cornstarch

In a medium saucepan combine peaches, brown sugar, cinnamon, and  honey and bring to a low simmer. Juice lemons and add cornstarch to lemon juice and mix until smooth. Add to pot and mix well. Simmer 10 minutes and let cool slightly before pouring filling into pie crust.

80,"I went to the Culinary Institute of America. You could choose either pastry or culinary (2 years). I chose baking and pastry. I know there is a savory class that's 3 weeks which covers the basics (knife skills, stocks, sauces, cooking methods).. If you were a culinary student, there was a 3 week baking class that covered the different baking methods..I find the culinary side to be more stressful. However, with recipes you can alter things greatly to get the desired taste you're looking for.. With baking, it's a science. Adding too much baking powder or not enough flour can give you failing results (and you won't know until it's out of the oven). I find pastry to be slower paced and it takes patience (like making macarons or icing a cake). In my experience the pastry instructors were more relaxed than the culinary chefs. I'd get some experience maybe working in a restaurant or a bakery first.. See which one appeals to you more. If you like one over the other, then you could go to school to learn more.. Or continue learning by working in different areas.. ",2,1536732054,2018-09-12

Most of the rest of the world does not do this, thus can keep their eggs on the counter.

I like the [Pyrex Basics pie pans](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/08/how-to-choose-the-best-pie-pan.html). You do need to be careful if you put them in the freezer, because they can shatter if you take them to temperature extremes, but being able to see the color of your crust as you bake is a real bonus when you're new.

It‚Äôs really just a scam. The ‚Äúinventor‚Äù ggcakecraft claims to hold a patent. Which I highly doubt. Having worked for one of the largest patent law firms in the United States where I processed  documents with the patent office for patents, trademarks, copyrights, I can tell you that recipes cannot be patented. The government considers recipes nothing more than a list of ingredients. Just like you can‚Äôt patent a grocery list you can‚Äôt patent a recipe.  Patents are issued for ""new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof"".

 The only way a recipe in a cookbook is protected is by copyright. And you can only copyright a recipe when it is included in a book of recipes. You cannot copyright a single recipe. 

 Even still fair use laws allows for the reproduction of copyright material under certain circumstances.  And it‚Äôs a legal defense that is used all the time. So even a copyright won‚Äôt fully protect a recipe in the cookbook.

Since patents are public anyone can search for a patent on the United States Patent and Trademark Office website. There‚Äôs no patent listed for Korean Buttercream.

233,"What type of buttercream is it? Without knowing the recipe you're using, it's hard to offer specific help. But here are a few generic tips that I've learned over the years. I had trouble regulating the consistency when I first started making it. 

- The butter should be completely 100% at room temp before starting. I'd never let the butter come completely to room temp at first. Then I would thin it out, and then when the buttercream sat out it would loosen up too much as it warmed up.
- Always use cream instead of milk. 
- If you are in a warm environment, consider using some shortening in place of butter. It has a higher melting point and holds up better in warm temperatures. I don't care for the greasy mouthfeel that shortening gives buttercream but sometimes the sacrifice is necessary.

*Yield:* two 8"" cake layers

*Special Equipment Needed:* Food Processor. Stand or Hand Mixer.

**Pistachio Paste**

* Shelled Pistachios, 100g
* Granulated Sugar, 50g
* Softened Butter, 50g
* Almond Extract, 10g
* Green Dye, 1 Drop

1. Combine pistachios and sugar in food processor. Process until pistachios break down into a paste.
2. Add butter, almond extract, and drop of green dye. Pulse until well combined and smooth.
3. Finished paste can be darker in color than expected. A forest green tone is normal, as the color will be less concentrated in whatever batter or buttercream you add it to. Paste should be kept well covered and refrigerated after use.

**Pistachio Cake**

* Cake Flour, 400g
* Granulated Sugar, 400g
* Large Eggs, 4
* Sour Cream, 320g
* Pistachio Paste, 4oz
* Unsalted Butter, 4oz
* Vegetable Oil, 2oz
* Baking Powder, 24g
* Vanilla Extract, 6g
* Almond Extract, 6g

1. Cream Butter, Pistachio Paste, Sugar, Baking Powder, and Salt until light and fluffy.
2. Add eggs one at a time while mixing, scraping bowl as necessary.
3. Stream in oil and extracts while mixing. Scrape bowl well.
4. Alternate adding sifted flour and sour cream until just combined.
5. (Optional) Fold in more crushed pistachios as desired, about 50g-100g for this recipe.
6. Distribute batter between prepared cake pans and bake at 325F low fan. Check at 50 minutes, cake is done when tested comes out clean.

*Pistachio Paste mixes in very well with buttercream, pastry creams, simple syrup etc. Some paste recipes call for removing the skins from the nuts prior to use. I prefer to leave them on, both for convenience and for the added texture. Make life easier and buy pre-shelled pistachios, such as Costco's Kirkland brand or Wonderful brand which can be ordered off Amazon.*",3,1536779638,2018-09-12

301,"I used a modification of this Bon Appetit recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/focaccia-bread

Recipe wise, I stupidly grabbed instant yeast instead of regular active, but it worked out fine. I still proofed it thinking it couldn't hurt, and the yeast foamed up nicely. I added an additional 4 tablespoons of flour after mixing the yeast - it was just too loose and goopy, and I don't think it suffered any for it. I finished it off with fresh rosemary, thyme, and a flake sea salt with wild garlic.

I would recommend checking your oven temp and following the center rack advice. Mine was set slightly below center and I ended up with a slightly burnt bottom. I grated it off and just pretended it was fine, but it's an extra step that I wouldn't want to do again. Might have helped the top brown juuuust a little more too. 

Overall, delicious! I limited myself to a corner wedge for now, and I'll be mixing some olive oil and herbs to enjoy this while Florence brings the wind and rain. ",12,1536785267,2018-09-12

Thanks! Here‚Äô the link for the white chocolate mud cake, this is tried and true and always seems to get heaps of positive feedback it‚Äôs a really nice cake. I don‚Äôt have a copy of it now but I converted everything into grams and adapted the recipe to make one 10 inch, one 8 inch, and one 6 inch cake with each cut into two layers. It freezes amazing well so I made the cakes gradually in the week or two beforehand and wrapped up very air tight and froze. For some reason it‚Äôs almost better after being frozen. I used dowels and support boards for the structure.

https://www.nigella.com/recipes/members/oooolivoooos-white-chocolate-mud-cake

Below is the recipe for the white chocolate buttercream, again I just converted into grams and made a few quantities. When I make it a day or so ahead and refrigerate I just use a hand beater to whip air into it and make it light and fluffy again.

http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/white-chocolate-buttercream

I just used a standard white ganache recipe, it was a warm day so I think I may have used a 4:1 ratio (with white choc being a bit more temperamental)? I used it for the crumb coat and also piped a thick ring around the periphery of each layer to ‚Äòdam in‚Äô the white choc buttercream.

Finally I used the below method to make a few batches of swiss meringue buttercream with some colouring gel at the end:
4 large egg whites, 300g caster sugar, 400g butter, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix egg whites and sugar in a heat proof bow and use a double boiler (low heat) and mix together with a whisk for a few minutes until sugar is dissolved. Don‚Äôt want to cook it out too hot - check mix by running some between fingers. When smooth place into mixer bowl, using whisk attachment place on medium-high speed for about 10-15 minutes until completely cool. Should be white, fluffy and cool. Now add cubed soft butter piece by piece on a medium speed. Don‚Äôt rush this bit, won‚Äôt look like proper swiss meringue until near the end. Should be silky, smooth and slightly off-white. Add vanilla extract.

The plumerias were just done with gum paste and decorated with edible dust. Wires glued in with tylose for support on the cake.

 

Thanks

8,"This looks like delicious bread!! Never let others or yourself discourage you because something doesn't look great or isn't quite perfect - you put your heart into this bread and it shows, and I'm certain it tastes fantastic! Be proud of what you made! 

Dough is *very* weird and picky. Maybe your yeast was unusually active, maybe your flour had a lower protein content than the recipe asked for. Hell, it could be a matter of: room temperature, humidity, air pressure, age of ingredients, brand of ingredients, how much you kneaded it (or how you kneaded it), if you moved it after it proofed, how deep/wide of a pan you used or what the pan was made out of, if you used cooking spray or not, how you rolled it into its loaf shape... Or probably many other things I can't think of right now.

I know that sounds daunting, but I mean for it to be the opposite! With baking, shit's just gonna happen sometimes. As you get better and more familiar it'll happen less often, you'll be able to recognize what the issues are before they happen, and you'll get better fixing or working around shortcomings and limitations... But shit is always gonna happen and that's okay!

Baking is an art. It's also definitely a science, and it's one we carry out in very non-scientific settings; and that's where the art comes in. You need to bake your bread when it looks and feels ""right,"" you need to stop kneading/mixing when it looks and feels ""right,"" there will be some occasions/recipes where you have to actually alter ingredients until it looks and feels ""right."" The more practice you get the better you'll be at understanding what ""right"" is and how to reach it.",6,1534128668,2018-08-12

First, I halved the recipe. It would have been MASSIVE otherwise. I still have 12 servings. 

I used brown cane sugar instead of white granulated. Added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Once the dough was combined I formed it into a ball, cut in two, and made each into a 3/4‚Äù-1‚Äù tall round. Cut into sixths to made 12 wedges. I only needed about half an eggs worth of egg wash (thinned with a little water, a tbsp or two). 

I added a pinch or so of cinnamon and cloves to the glaze and added the confectioners sugar gradually to get to the consistency I wanted. Didn‚Äôt use the whole amount. 

Baked for probably 25 minutes and let cool on a rack for 5-10 minutes. Glaze each individually and garnish with some oats and cane sugar. ",3,1534128949,2018-08-12

64,"Context: My friend Rob's birthday had recently passed but him and his wife were planning on having people over as they are going overseas for a few months for work. She messaged me a link to a video showing Human Face Pie art pieces made by It Came From Under My Bed (r/https://www.facebook.com/It-Came-From-Under-My-Bed-1420468108204875/) and I thought it might be a good thing to bring as guests usually bring food right!?!

For the pie crust is made from a Serious Eats recipe. Video here:¬†r/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFUjqxR9h6c

Recipe here by Stella Parks (who I believe is the one in the video): r/https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/06/how-to-make-a-beautifully-flaky-pie-crust.html

This crust recipe is actually quite nice and flakey but just make sure to roll your dough out fast after the 2 hours of resting time in the fridge. I had to sort of scrap my first attempt because I decided to let my husband do it and then realized he didn't know how to roll dough out and was just pushing the rolling pin on top of the dough with the tip of his fingers and the dough got too soft/warm....I still had to roll it pretty quickly in my second attempt. To form the ridges of the face, I took some excess dough, formed it into a nose, tops and bottoms of a lip, brow ridge, and eyelid and then froze the dough for about 20 minutes. I then baked these pieces at 425 for about 15-20 minutes until they were ridged.

The filling is made from this recipe here:¬†r/https://bakingamoment.com/classic-blueberry-pie-recipe/ by Allie from Baking A Moment. I slightly modified it as I didn't use her crust and I didn't have lemons/only limes (so lime zest and lemon zest) and only 4 cups of blueberries (but I didn't really adjust the proportions elsewhere). I ended up baking it for about an hour and a half at 425 for the first 20 minutes and 350 for the rest (because I like my pies gooey I baked it a little longer than what she had listed and also because I didn't know if the 350 was for gas or convection oven -I think it was gas so actually I was probably baking it at 325F).

I rolled some of the dough into the pie dish, filled it with the filling recipe, and used chopsticks to arrange the brow ridge, eyelids, nose, and lips on top fo the blueberry filling. Then I put the rest of the rolled out pie dough and layed it on top of the face. I used my fingers and their heat to gently push down on the pie crust dough so that it conformed to the prebaked pie face pieces. I used a knife to cut slits for the eyes, nostrils, and mouth. I then used a letter embossing set for baking to write Happy Bday Rob around the side of the pie into the crust and¬† then I baked it!¬†

After baking it/while still warm, I used a mixture of simple syrup mixed with brown, burgundy, and purple gel food coloring to paint on definition onto the pie. I started with larger areas of burgundy, then detailed with with brown and purple.

This pie was super interesting to make and everyone loved it and was horrified by it at the same time!",1,1534138805,2018-08-13

Another thing, I‚Äôd recommend to find a recipe that uses grams or ounces, and using a kitchen scale to measure out ingredients. Baking, especially bread, has to be fairly exact and using cups to measure flour is one of the easiest ways to mess up the proportions. If you pack flour into a cup, it can be up to double the amount of flour weight-wise than needed, which weighs your bread down and makes a dense bread. ",3,1534146684,2018-08-13

122,"**Approximate recipe** (I tend to just throw things together. )

**Filling**
* 4-5 apples, I like a mix of Granny Smith and Fuji
* 1 pint blueberries, washed and drained
* 1/2 cup lemon juice
* 3 TBSP corn starch 
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1/2 TBSP cinnamon 
* 1 tsp. nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp. ground ginger

**Topping**
* 1/3 cup softened butter
* 1/3 cup maple sugar
* 1 cup raw oats
* 1 cup walnuts, ground
* 1/2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped

1.  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees
2. Peel, core, and chop apples thinly,  toss with half the lemon juice
3. Stir cornstarch into remaining lemon juice to make a slurry, add to apples. If cornstarch clumps at the bottom, add a little water and stir until pourable.
4. Add remaining ingredients to the apples except blueberries. Stir thoroughly. Then, add the blueberries and gently toss. 
5. Pour filling into ungreased, 9 inch glass baking dish.
6. In a bowl (I used the same one), add all topping ingredients and mix together. I cut in the fat and syrup using a pastry blade or my hands.

Tips for walnuts: I grind frozen walnuts into a flour consistency with my food processor. To ""coarsely chop"", I crumble the walnuts in my hands.

7. Once crumble ingredients are fully integrated, sprinkle on top of apple mixture, being sure to cover evenly.
8. Bake at 350 for 40ish minutes until top is light brown and crunchy and filling is bubbling.
9. Let cool 20 min. Enjoy alone or with vanilla ice cream.",1,1534162754,2018-08-13

There are a lot of little steps, but they're easy :) 

**Ingredients**  
1 cup boiling water  
3 oz. unsweetened chocolate  
¬Ω cup sweet butter (1 stick)  
1 tsp. vanilla extract  
2 cup granulated white sugar  
2 eggs, separated  
1 tsp. baking soda  
1/2 cup sour cream  
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour  
1 tsp. baking powder

**Directions**  
Preheat oven to 350¬∞.

Coat cake tin with thin layer of butter, then flour. Knock out the excess flour and set aside. \***I recommend using a cake strip around a regular cake tin to prevent the cake from dipping in the middle, or use a tube pan!\*** 

In a large heatproof bowl, pour the boiling water over the chocolate and butter. Let the mixture stand until melted.

Stir in the vanilla and sugar, then whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time, until blended.

Mix the baking soda and the sour cream in a small bowl, and then whisk into the chocolate mixture.

Whisk the flour and baking powder in a small bowl, and then add to the chocolate mixture, mixing thoroughly.

Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Stir a quarter of the egg whites into the batter.

Scoop the remaining egg whites on top of the batter and gently fold them in until the batter is almost uniform in color.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 45-55 minutes or until the edges have pulled away from the pan and the cake tester inserted comes out clean.

Cool in pan for 20 minutes; remove from tin, and cool completely before frosting.",1,1534163580,2018-08-13

468,"Cake: Recipe from my baking instructor Wendy McGowen:

Ingredients

1 cup Butter (2 sticks) salted or unsalted (room temperature)

500 grams (2 ¬Ω cups) Sugar

4 eggs

1 1/2 tsp vanilla

275 grams (2 ¬º cups) all-purpose flour

85 grams (3/4 cup) cocoa powder

2 tsp baking soda

¬Ω tsp baking powder

¬Ω tsp salt

2 cups water

Directions

* Cream the butter and sugar together in a mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Once eggs are incorporated, add vanilla, then mix on medium until light and fluffy.
* Combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl (flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, salt)
* Add dry ingredients and water in 3 alternating batches starting and ending with dry ingredients. Mix well, but do not over mix and pour into pans or cupcake liners.
* Bake at 350 degrees.

Cupcakes: Bake for 15-18 minutes

Mini cupcakes: Bake for 7-11 minutes

6‚Äù cakes: Bake for 20-30 minutes

8 or 9‚Äù cakes: Bake for 30-40 minutes.

Bake until top of cake springs back when touched and toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center. If your cakes start pulling away from the edge of the pan, they have been cooked too long.

36,"Well without knowing what exactly was wrong with your frosting I'd guess it either had to do with butter clumping or being runny. 

Lemon juice and pure vanilla would be excellent substitutes so I doubt it was that. 

For this particular recipe your fats and cream cheese would both have to be soft and whipped well together. You don't want your butter so warm that it's melty either though. 

When it comes to adding the milk, add it slowly. Some recipes will say just to dump it in but, unless it's a tried and true recipe, don't do that. Start with a tablespoon or two so that the consistency will stay how you want. In my opinion 1/4c. of milk sounds like a little too much for the amount of dry ingredients.  

If you do end up with a runny icing, add more icing sugar. This may make it too sweet but you can add a little salt to cut that sweetness. 

Hope this helps a little! ",2,1531539560,2018-07-13

I used this, most cake pops are quite similar. I use a food processor to chop up my cake and then mixed frosting into the crumbs until it is JUST able to form a smooth ball (make sure it isn't too heavy; it might fall in the candy melts).

For the lemon I used lemon juice, zest, and some extract and topped it with some lemon zest.

If the chocolate cake/frosting/coating is too sweet, cut it with a bit of instant espresso and top with some cocoa powder. Espresso chocolate pops are also pretty good!

For the coating, i add some shortening to the candy melts to make it a little thinner.

Ratios are probably related to stoichiometrics or integral ratios, aka ""This is the best result if you put xmg with ymg, not xmg and zmg."" Certain processes like the Maillard reaction is what happens when sugars are reduced and form bonds with free amino acids (or proteins aka searing meat),, it's critically dependant on temperature and pH (Maillard is also what makes sugar into caramel, it's why you need a candy thermometer). Eggs have all the essential amino acids required for life, so basically there's a lot of chemical reactions it can undergo: foaming, emulsifying, coagulating, etc. Food chemistry, food science and molecular gastronomy are entire disciplines unto themselves and really fascinating, unfortunately I didn't major in it.",1,1531553768,2018-07-14

160,"Make sure your egg whites are completely at room temperature (I will leave mine out overnight if I know I am whipping egg whites the next day). Separate them properly from the egg yolk (if the yolk gets in, it will prevent it from whipping properly). Use a glass or metal bowl (make sure the bowl is completely clean and dry, so that it is free of any residual oils which prevents proper whipping). You can choose to use a pinch of salt to help stabilize the egg whites as you whip them. Start off on a low speed and work your way up to a medium/high speed while whipping in circular motions, until you get soft peaks. All of those tips should help you get soft peaks! (For stiffer peaks, obviously whip longer until the egg whites can stand up stiffly on it's own like little mountain peaks). ",4,1531579748,2018-07-14
161,"It shouldn't take an hour.  I'd guess about 2 minutes for soft peaks, 4 minutes for firm peaks.  So if it's taking an hour, something is wrong.

Avoid contamination - moisture, grease, soap residue in even tiny amounts can cause problems.  Make sure your bowl and beaters are super clean and dry.

Take your eggs out of the fridge (if you keep 'em there) and allow them to come up to room temperature before separating.  If they're fridge cold they may have condensation on the shells, which can cause moisture contamination.  Make sure they're good and dry before cracking.  And of course don't get any yolk in your whites.

**The cookie**

Ingredients

* 1 1/4 cup salted butter
* 1 cup loosely packed light brown sugar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 large egg
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 1 heaping TBSP molasses
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 3/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp cloves
* 3 cups uncooked quick oats

**Making the batter**

1. Bring butter to room temperature.
2. Preheat oven to 375¬∞. Line your baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. If you don‚Äôt use parchment paper, you may want to adjust your oven temperature to 350¬∞.
3. Use a hand or stand mixer to combine butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar to a creamy texture. This will be two or three minutes on a medium speed
4. With the mixer running, add the egg, vanilla and molasses.  Scrape down the sides as needed and mix thoroughly. Set aside.
5. In a small bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and cloves.
6. With the mixer running on low, slowly add the dry ingredients until incorporated. Be sure to scrape down sides to make sure the batter is evenly mixed.
7. With the mixer running on low, add the oatmeal. Your batter will be pretty thick once the oatmeal is added. Don‚Äôt overmix. This is the perfect texture.
8. Directions ‚Äì Baking the cookies
9. Use a small cookie scoop to create cookie drops. You want these to be the same size as they‚Äôll be paired up in sandwiches.
10. Place cookie scoops on parchment-lined baking sheet about 2 inches apart. The cookies will need room to spread.
11. Bake for 10 minutes.
12. Remove from oven and gently tap the baking sheet on the counter before placing on cooling rack. This should flatten the cookies just a bit.
13. Allow the cookies too completely cool on the baking sheet.

**The filling**

Ingredients

* 3/4 cup salted butter
* 3 cups powered sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 1/4 cup heavy cream

**Making the filling**

1. Use a hand or stand mixer to cream butter. This will be two or three minutes on a medium speed.
2. Slowly incorporate the powered sugar one cup at a time. Make sure your butter and powered sugar are evenly mixed without lumps.
3. With the mixer running, add the vanilla.
4. Scrape down sides of bowl and slowly mix to make sure all ingredients are blended.
5. Add heavy whipping cream.
6. On high, beat the mixture until light and fluffy. This will be about three to four minutes.

**Assembly instructions**

Don‚Äôt try to spread the filling on your cookies. Pipe it! 

1. Make sure your cookies have completely cooled.
2. Pair the cookies up and flip half of the cookies over. You‚Äôll add your icing to the flat side.
3. Get a quart or gallon Ziploc bag. Anything smaller will be too small for the amount of filling prepared.
4. Scoop the filling into the corner of the bag and twist the top to remove any air.
5. Snip the corner of the bag to create a DIY piping bag. I prefer a 1/2 inch size hole.
6. Add a swirl of filling to half of the cooled cookies. Try to keep the frosting away from the edges.
7. Place the second cookie on top of the filling. Lightly press. This should evenly push the frosting out to the sides of the cookies.

**Storing your cookies**

You should have around 20-24 cookie sandwiches based on the size of your small cookie scoop. Store your cookies in an airtight container. I keep the closed container out overnight, but then store in the fridge.

298,"For the cupcakes themselves... I honestly used white cake box mix to save time this time.

Italian Meringue Buttercream (flavored Espresso this time.)
- 6 oz egg whites
- 12 oz sugar
- 4 oz water
- 16 oz (1 lb) unsalted butter

I used the basic method for making an Italian Meringue BC. Cooked the sugar syrup (water and sugar) to 238¬∞F while whipping egg whites on a stand mixer. When eggs and syrup were both ready, with the mixer still running, slowly poured the syrup into the egg whites. leave it running until it cools (and whips into meringue.) While it whips and cools, chop your cold butter. when meringue is cool (and still mixing) add the cold yet softened butter a little at a time. It will look broken!! but let it keep whipping and mixing and it'll come back together turning into Buttercream! 

You can flavor it however you want... vanilla, lemon zest, whatever! This time I bought Instant Espresso powder, poured some into a cup, added just enough water to make it a smooth, barely liquid flavoring, and poured it into the buttercream and mix it to the desired taste. 

As for the chocolate decor... you can go through the whole process of tempering chocolate by hand (which is fun but complicated,) so this time I saved time by grabbing a nice bag of coating chocolate (Candy Melts) at the grocery store, melt it and it's good  to go and will firm up on it's own!",3,1531598052,2018-07-14

1/4 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons milk
4 tablespoons key lime juice

For the Key Lime Buttercream:
1 cup butter, room temperature
4 cups powdered sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt 
1 tbsp whipping cream
1-3 tbsp key lime juice 

To make the cupcakes:
1. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F and prepare a cupcake pan with cupcake liners.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light in color and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Do not skimp on the amount of creaming time.
3. Add sour cream, vanilla extract and and key lime zest and mix until well combined.
4. Add egg whites in two batches, mixing until well combined after each. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to be sure all ingredients are well incorporated.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.
6. In a separate small measuring cup, combine the milk and key lime juice.
7. Add half of the dry ingredients to the batter and mix until well combined. Add the milk mixture and mix until well combined. Add remaining dry ingredients and mix until combined, taking care not to overmix. 
8. Fill the cupcake liners about three quarters full. Bake for 15-17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs.

To make the buttercream:
1. Beat butter with electric mixer until light in color and completely smooth. 
2. Add two cups sugar, one cup at a time, beating until incorporated. 
3. Add vanilla, cream, salt, and 1 tbsp juice.
4. Add remaining sugar, one cup at a time, and beat on low until incorporated. Add additional key lime juice until desired consistency and taste is achieved.

336,"I had this problem for a long time, and a lot of it was using a plastic bowl, and also keeping the eggs in the fridge beforehand. Eggs whip best at room temperature, so if you have them out it will speed up considerably. Plastic bowls are apparently extremely difficult to clean properly so there can be grease residue which will stop your whites foaming properly. Use a glass or metal bowl. Before making meringues or whipping whites for whatever, I always splash a little vinegar into the empty bowl and wipe it around with some kitchen roll - this apparently helps remove any greasy residue",2,1531602913,2018-07-14

I would definitely check your oven though. You could invest in a toaster oven. I rent out a room in a house so the kitchen isn't always available. I'm not promising perfect results, but if your oven is off, a toaster oven will do. It takes a little longer, but eh, it can hold you over until you get your oven fixed. Good luck.

If you do go with cream cheese some people find it not sweet enough but that‚Äôs easy to fix by adding more confectioners sugar. This recipe by Martha Stewart is the one I use most often with a bit more sugar.

480,"A suggestion for next time: build it upside down.

Spread a layer of buttercream on a Silpat silicone baking mat, and put the first layer on top.

Build up the layers as you would do normally, keeping the layers level, but leave the 'top' bare.

Tidy the sides so that the buttercream is smooth and the edge between the 'base' and the sides sharp and crisp.

Lightly cover with plastic wrap and freeze until buttercream is firm.

Remove from the freezer and flip the cake onto your glazing rack, then peel off the Silpat.

Voila! A perfectly flat top to your cake, ready for glazing.",2,1531636145,2018-07-15

22,"I use Southern Living's carrot cake supreme cake as a starting point and have tweaked a bit over the last decade or so, resulting in a near-perfect carrot cake (in my humble opinion). One thing I've found is that carrot cakes are so soft and moist that they hold up better if you bake them darker than most cakes. I take them about 5 minutes past where I would pull a standard cake, and then once I frost the layers, it's perfect. 

Also, I'm all about crushed pineapple in carrot cake, but make sure to squeeze all the excess juice out of it, even after draining it. I usually set it in a mesh strainer for ten minutes or so and then give it a good press to make sure it's as dry as possible. Otherwise my recipe is very similar to yours; I add half a cup of flaked coconut as well. The cardamom is a brilliant choice, and I'll think I'll give that a go next time.",3,1528943270,2018-06-13

131,"When beating the meringue, err on the heavy side instead of under-beating. Also, some very important steps often ignored by the beginners are:
1) aging the egg whites before beating them
2) tapping the hell out of the macarons after piping them. We throw them from a high of couple feet on the ground to get all the air bubbles out
3) allowing the pipes shells to rest, in order to form a thin layer on top of them, that seals the air inside when baked. This causes the feet to form when the air escapes

133,"Recipe for swedish kanelbullars:
For the dough:
75 g of butter or margarine
250 ml milk
25 g yeast
75 g sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cardamom, ground
500 g of flour (wheat flour)
For the filling:
37 1/2 g of butter or margarine
50 g glucose
1/2 EL cinnamon
1/2 egg (s), to brush
sugar

Melt butter or margarine, add the milk and heat to about 37 degrees, then dissolve the yeast in the milk, then add the sugar, salt, cardamom and almost all the flour.

Knead the dough until it becomes smooth. (If necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãadd a little more flour.)

Then cover the dough with a towel and let it rise for about 30 to 40 minutes.

Knead the dough on a floury work surface.

Then split into two parts, roll out one thin, rectangular surface each.

Cover with soft margarine or butter, mix sugar and cinnamon, sprinkle the dough with it thickly.
Wrap into a roll, cut into slices about 4 cm thick. Place them on baking tray.

Let the dough rise again (about twice as big in 30 minutes).
Brush the cannelbullar (cinnamon buns) with beaten egg, then sprinkle with sugar.

Bake in the middle stage in a preheated oven at 220 degrees for about  8 minutes.
Cool under a towel

I had no Kardamom, so i did not use that. I also didnt use the beaten Egg with sugar, i made frosting with Milk and powdered sugar.

* dropped the nuts -- after a side by side comparison, I prefer without
* added approximately 1/2-3/4 cup of golden raisins (I don't really measure, just dump a bunch in)
* use only about half the buttermilk glaze and add about half a tsp salt to the glaze (you're gonna think that glaze is fussy, but give it a try; it's delicious and the leftovers are amazing with ice cream)
* brown the butter for the cream cheese frosting
* and as we discussed, squeeze as much liquid as possible out of everything, and bake an extra few minutes

309,"[Recipe!](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/pizza-crust-recipe)

2 tsp active dry or instant yeast

198 to 255g lukewarm water (lower amount in summer or humid environment, higher amount in winter, or somewhere in the middle for the rest of the year)

25g olive oil

361g All-Purpose Flour

1 1/4 tsp salt

**Method:** (copied and pasted from the link)

1. If you're using active dry yeast, dissolve it, with a pinch of sugar, in 2 tablespoons of the lukewarm water. Let the yeast and water sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, until the mixture has bubbled and expanded. If you're using instant yeast, you can skip this step.

2. Combine the dissolved yeast (or the instant yeast) with the remainder of the ingredients. Mix and knead everything together‚Äîby hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle‚Äîtill you've made a soft, smooth dough. If you're kneading in a stand mixer, it should take 4 to 5 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom. Don't over-knead the dough; it should hold together, but can still look fairly rough on the surface.

3. To make pizza up to 24 hours later, skip to step 5.

4. To make pizza now: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rise till it's very puffy. This will take about an hour using instant yeast, or 90 minutes using active dry. If it takes longer, that's OK; just give it some extra time.

5. To make pizza later: Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate the dough for 4 hours (or for up to 24 hours); it will rise slowly as it chills. This step allows you more schedule flexibility; it also develops the crust's flavor. About 2 to 3 hours before you want to serve pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator.

6. Decide what size, shape, and thickness of pizza you want to make. This recipe will make one of the following choices:¬†
Two 1/2""-thick 14"" round pizzas (pictured);¬†
Two 3/4""-thick 12"" round pizzas;¬†
One 3/4"" to 1""-thick 13"" x 18"" rectangular (Sicilian-style) pizza (pictured);¬†
One 1 1/2""-thick 9"" x 13"" rectangular pizza;¬†
One 1""-thick 14"" round pizza. 

7. Divide the dough in half, for two pizzas; or leave it whole for one pizza.

8. If you're making a rectangular pizza, shape the dough into a rough oval. For a round pizza, shape it into a rough circle. In either case, don't pat it flat; just stretch it briefly into shape. Allow the dough to rest, covered with an overturned bowl or lightly greased plastic wrap, for 15 minutes.

9. Use vegetable oil pan spray to lightly grease the pan(s) of your choice. Drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the pan(s). The pan spray keeps the pizza from sticking; the olive oil gives the crust great flavor and crunch.

10. Place the dough in the prepared pan(s). Press it over the bottom of the pan, stretching it towards the edges. You'll probably get about two-thirds of the way there before the dough starts shrinking back; walk away for 15 minutes. Cover the dough while you're away, so it doesn't dry out.

11. When you come back, you should be able to pat the dough closer to the corners of the pan. Repeat the rest and dough-stretch one more time, if necessary; your goal is to get the dough to fill the pan as fully as possible.

12. Allow the dough to rise, covered, till it's noticeably puffy, about 90 minutes (if it hasn't been refrigerated); or 2 to 2 1/2 hours (if it's been refrigerated). Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450¬∞F.

13. Bake the pizza on the lower oven rack till it looks and feels set on top, and is just beginning to brown around the edge of the crust, but is still pale on top. This will take about 8 minutes for thinner crust pizza; about 10 to 12 minutes for medium thickness; and 12 to 14 minutes for thick-crust pizza. If you're baking two pizzas, reverse them in the oven (top to bottom, bottom to top) midway through the baking period.

14. To serve pizza immediately: Remove it from the oven, and arrange your toppings of choice on top. Return to the oven, and bake on the upper oven rack for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned, both top and bottom, and the cheese is melted. Check it midway through, and move it to the bottom rack if the top is browning too much, or the bottom not enough.

15. To serve pizza up to 2 days later: Remove the untopped, partially baked crust from the oven, cool completely on a rack, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature. When ready to serve, top and bake in a preheated 450¬∞F oven, adding a couple of minutes to the baking times noted above. Your goal is a pizza whose crust is browned, and whose toppings are hot/melted.

16. Remove the pizza from the oven, and transfer it from the pan to a rack to cool slightly before serving. For easiest serving, cut with a pair of scissors.",1,1529007296,2018-06-14

Macarons 1 (classic method)
125g powdered almonds
200g icing sugar
100g egg whites
40g granulated sugar

Blend almonds and icing sugar in food processor for 5 min, then sift.  Whip egg whites to soft peaks, gradually add granulated sugar and continue to whip to firm peaks. Fold in egg white into sugar/almong mixture 1/3 at a time until smooth. Pipe onto pan. Rattle pan to release air bubbles, and allow to rest 10-15 min to form skin. Bake at 320 for 15-25min or until barely moving when lightly pressed and wiggled


Macarons 2 (italian method)
125g icing sugar
125g powdered almonds
60g egg whites
50g water
125g granulated sugar
50g egg whites

Blend almonds and icing sugar in food processor 5 min. Sift. Mix in first egg whites u til smooth. In a pot, heat water and granulated sugar until boiling and reaches 243f (117c). Remove from heat. In a separate bowl beat egg whites until soft peaks. While still whipping, slowly drizzle hot sugar mixture into egg whites  (best to let it drizzle down bowl into egg whites). Continue beating until meringue is cool and forms firm peaks. Fold meringue into almond mixture until smooth. Pipe onto pan. Rattle pan to release air bubbles, and allow to rest 10-15 min to form skin. Bake at 320 for 15-25min or until barely moving when lightly pressed and wiggled

If the recipe for the 2 layers calls for it them be made in one pan and then cut in half to make the layers, I would recommend making the third in a separate pan, and watching it for the time.

If the original recipe has each layer cooked separately, I would imagine they would all be the same, but you might have to bake them in batches to make sure there's room for hem in your oven.

If in doubt, you could always make the recipe twice and use the ""extra layer"" to make cake pops or some other dessert",2,1529020285,2018-06-14

479,I just use a digital meat thermometer. But a candy one you can clip to the pot. Meat one you have to hold over the pot which is a little trickier. Just dont buy a cheap one. I learned that the hard way the first time i made fudge lol. Bout one for $15...Cooked it for 2hrs waiting for it to come to temp..realized something was wrong when it started smoking. Only buy $30 and up. ,2,1529036812,2018-06-15

8,"I started baking about 6 months ago as a form of stress relief and have found myself loving the process. For my third or fourth ever bake, I thought I‚Äôd try my hand at macarons and they turned out...fairly okay actually. Seriously, I never thought that watching little almond cookies developing tiny feet could bring me so much joy.

Since then, I‚Äôve made macarons many more times. I find the ritual of it very soothing and because they look so simple, you can really get creative with decorating them. They‚Äôre like small blank canvasses waiting to be painted.

Fast forward another 3 months and i found r/baking. I was fascinated by all the posts and it was great to see other new bakers trying out thing and posting their successes and failures. If i had known about r/baking when i started, I‚Äôd definitely have posted a pic or two.

What‚Äôs my point?

I guess I just want to say, and I mean this in the most respectful way possible, please don‚Äôt shit over other peoples joy of baking. For you macarons and unicorn cakes are old hat and nausea inducing. For me i actually love seeing what other people are trying and getting ideas about what works and what doesn‚Äôt.

117,"&lt;inserting obligatory southern phrase in 3...2...&gt; Bless your heart!

Kolaches, hailing from Czech like OP said, are basically bread stuffed with *insert food* that you eat for breakfast. 

1. They can be a sweet bread with an open face that has macerated fruit on it (IMO the less popular version in Texas) 

OR 

2. They are either a yeasted bread (think dinner roll) or flaky dough (think southern biscuit - not puff pastry) that is filled with any delicious combination of breakfast food: chorizo, eggs, cheese, potatoes, sausage, bacon, jalape√±o, etc. Unless it‚Äôs like just sausage (like OPs) then they‚Äôre typically fully enclosed and the only way to know what‚Äôs inside is through use of a ouija board. (Jk! It‚Äôll probably have something backed on top to Identify it, like a jalape√±o slice, or you jus have to guess). 

As far as I know several states have franchise stores called Kolache Factory but in Texas we have whole stores and restaurants dedicated to them, and many donut shops sell them as well, ESPECIALLY in Central Texas where many Czechs immigrated. ",3,1526381370,2018-05-15

129,"**Klob√°sn√≠k**

A klob√°sn√≠k , pl. klob√°sn√≠ky, is a savory finger food of Czech origin. A klobasnek is often thought to be a variation of the kolach (kol√°ƒçe); however, most Czechs hold the distinction that kolache are only filled with non-meat fillings. Unlike kolache, which came to the United States with Czech immigrants, klobasniky were first made by Czechs that settled in Texas.

203,"Just a tip in case you're trying to whiten the buttercream - you'll see two or three methods discussed a lot online, and tbh, I've found that a combo of all three seems to work best.

So purple is opposite yellow on the colour wheel, and adding the tiniest dot of purple to yellow buttercream can actually cause it to appear whiter. Now, I mean the teeniest, tiniest dot. You can always add more, but it's harder to get the colour back to rights if you accidentally make it too purple! 

You can also whip the buttercream a lot, which can lighten the colour a little too.

Last but not least, you can use commercial icing whiteners.

Now, since I've found that the icing whiteners can sometimes require you to use a *lot* with real yellow butter, I worry about changing the consistency of the icing too much, so I combo all these.

I dot with purple and whip like crazy. In practice, I find that the purple trick can leave icing almost a little gray, more than white. But then you can use the icing whitener to effect a much better and more visible change to the colour by brightening that back up to white.

Hope that helps!",4,1526401816,2018-05-15

* FOR THE CRUMB TOPPING:
* ¬Ω cups Sugar
* 1 dash Salt
* 1 cup All\-purpose Flour
* 1 teaspoon Cinnamon
* 1 stick Unsalted Butter, melted

**FOR THE CAKE:**

* 2 whole Eggs
* 1\-¬Ω cup Sugar
* 1 stick Unsalted Butter, At Room Temperature
* 1 teaspoon Vanilla
* 1 cup Sour Cream
* 2 cups All\-purpose Flour
* 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1\-¬Ω teaspoon Cinammon
* ¬Ω teaspoons Salt
* 2 whole Apples, Peeled, Cored, And Diced
* Caramel Sauce, For Drizzling Over The Top \(optional\)

**Preparation**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F and butter and flour a tube pan.
2. For the crumb topping: Combine the sugar, salt, flour and cinnamon in  a bowl.  Stir in the melted butter and let the mixture sit while you  assemble the rest of the cake.
3. For the cake: In a large bowl cream together the eggs and sugar using  either a stand mixer or a hand mixer.  Beat in the butter.  Add the  vanilla and sour cream and continue mixing until combined.  
4. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and  salt.  Stir this dry mixture into the batter and mix.  Add the diced  apples and stir just until combined.

6. Allow cake to cool completely before removing from the pan. If desired, drizzle the top with your favorite caramel sauce.

352,"Some tips I‚Äôve learned from trial and error:

1. Always use room temperature ingredients. ALWAYS. I know it‚Äôs clich√©, but it really does matter, especially with cream cheese.

2. Grease and flour your pan generously or use baking spray with flour.

3. I use a water bath with every cheesecake I make, so I purchased this [Springform Pan Protector](http://perfectcheesecakebakeware.com/product/perfect-cheesecake-system-5/) to prevent soggy crusts! I‚Äôve never been successful with wrapping my springform pan in tin foil.

4. Beat your cream cheese like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, but don‚Äôt over mix your batter once you add your eggs. Your cheesecake will crack or have a significant amount of air bubbles on the top if it‚Äôs over mixed.

5. Do not open the oven while your cheesecake is baking. You‚Äôll release steam from the water bath which could lead to a cracked cheesecake.

6. I usually turn the oven off after the baking time and let my cheesecake bake/cool in the oven for about a half hour longer without opening the door.

7. Crack the oven door and let the cheesecake slowly cool for an hour or more afterward.

8. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let cool until room temperature or nearly room temperature.

9. Line a bowl big enough to cover the pan with paper towel and cover the cheesecake before setting it in the refrigerator to chill. This catches the condensation to prevent water droplets on the top of the cheesecake.

I rarely have to use a knife to release the cheesecake from the sides of the springform pan because if it‚Äôs well-greased, it will naturally separate leaving a smooth side. Once I‚Äôm ready to unmold, I unlatch the outside and put my hand on the bottom of the pan and raise the cheesecake up and through the ring. I find this to leave the cleanest appearance.",21,1526432641,2018-05-15

457,"Honestly I use American buttercream for everything since that's what my bakery uses. I make a batch for weddings using 5 lb butter, 1/4c vanilla paste, 9.75 lb 10Xsugar with a little cream for consistency because that's the size batch that covers our small mixer's paddle which creates a vacuum and gives you a perfect buttercream with no air bubbles. That's a frosting which can sit out a while. It also crusts on the outside so if you accidentally touch it lightly nothing happens. I'm not sure what our mixer's bowl capacity is, it's larger than the standard kitchen aid bowl though I'm pretty sure. ABC is my go to but if there's air bubbles and it sits out, it can lead to blowouts where the cake will get a bump on the side from air escaping. I haven't worked with any Italian, french, Swiss meringues for a long time, since before I was doing a lot of wedding cakes, so I'm afraid I don't have any advice for improving those.",1,1526456502,2018-05-16

467,"I think it varies wildly. I know there's not a lot of love for fondant on reddit, but I think it depends massively on the brand, and how much of it a decorator uses.

I use an irish made brand which has a subtle vanilla taste, and have had many comments on how tasty it is. Recently, I had to use another brand due to availability, and I didn't really care for it at all myself. Thought it didn't smell as nice, and while it tasted *ok*, it wasn't up to my usual standard, so I haven't used it since. (Thankfully it was just for a decorative model, so not something that would typically be eaten).

Also, these cakes are typically cut catering style, meaning finger slices. This means that each piece typically wouldn't have a lot of fondant on it, unless you were specifically seeking out an edge. Most, if not all, of the pieces presented once the cake was cut just had a small square of icing on the top, so it's easily avoided if you don't like it.",5,1526463070,2018-05-16

492,"If you mix is on the warm side, like mid-80s (Fahrenheit), then retard it, your dough should be fine for hours, probably even overnight.

The initial warmth is to give yeast a start at fermenting, but the dough will gradually cool, slowing the yeast and changing the flavors they create. You‚Äôll also encourage more enzymes activity, increasing the dough‚Äôs strength and extensibilty.

Personally, I‚Äôd recommend experimenting. Try giving a batch 24hrs in the fridge. Increase the water another time. Change one parameter at a time and you‚Äôll get a feel for what affects what. ",1,1526477783,2018-05-16

46,"Mason Cash makes the mixing bowls seen on ""The Great British Baking Show"" and they are AWESOME. A whole range of sizes, too - including a pretty damned big mixer. 

Do you know if she has an *RUSSIAN* piping tips? A set of those would be fun, if she doesn't already. 

I have [this bench scraper/knife](https://breadtopia.com/store/lamsonsharp-bench-knife/) and it is one of the best tools I've ever owned. Amazingly great. 

Digital scales. One for heavier things, one for lighter things (my digital scale is great for measuring out a kilo of flour, but it sucks for 7g of yeast...)

She's got a Kitchenaid mixer, and there are specialty attachments for it like a silicon-bladed mixer paddle and an 11-wire whisk. If she doesn't have either of those, they'd be a great choice. 

My top recommendation, though, is high-end or exotic baking ingredients. Whole vanilla beans are stupidly expensive right now (climate change had led to crop-destroying storms. The market is starting to bounce back, but real vanilla and whole beans are currently luxury purchases for most of us) and are incredibly useful and wonderful. Rare or ancient flours like teff, einkorn or erewhon are exciting. 

So, yeah. A huge-ass Mason-Cash mixing/proving bowl filled with exotic baking ingredients is just about the perfect gift for any baker. ",6,1523764905,2018-04-15

89,"I‚Äôm still learning as well but these are what I learned over the years:

* Having the right tools are important. For this, having an offset spatula, cake turntable stand and a bench scraper (cake side scraper) make all the difference
* crumb coating your cake and letting it chill before the final frosting is applied helps keep the cake tidy. 
* dont cheat on the chilling process. Chilled crumb-coated cake is easier to work with
* look at youtube for how to crumbcoat and apply frosting. Lately I like ‚Äúman about cakes‚Äù youtube videos. 
* First, you plop a good amount of frosting on top. To spread it around, use your offset spatula. Let the excess hang over the sides. Do the same for the sides. I learn to use small back/forth movement on the offset spatula (sort of like the miss america wave) to spread the frosting. Put more than what you think you need. You will scrape it smooth with your bench scraper next.
* What will make everything smooth is your bench scraper. Hold the bench scraper against the side of the cake. To keep it steady, keep your hand on a 90 deg angle close to your body to avoid extra wobbliness and movement. Hold it while your other hand turn the cakestand. Use one fluid motion if possible. Keep doing it and adding frosting to any pockmarks you see, and bench-scraping it till you have smooth sides
* you will have excess frosting on the edges where the top of your cake meet the sides. Smooth it out by bringing it towards the center with your offset spatula.",2,1523791408,2018-04-15

95,"What about cream cheese icing? It typically goes on a carrot or red velvet cake but it can be used on other cakes too, like [this one](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2014/02/09/lemon-blueberry-layer-cake/).

You can also make whipped cream and add as much sugar if you want, or none at all! Combine it with fresh fruits or berries.

I once made a pecan crumb cake and the top was covered in this pumpkin spice pecan crumb topping, like you would make for an apple crumble but with spices and chopped pecans. I baked the crumbs separately and stuck them to the cake using a thin coating of whipped cream.

I've also seen [this recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/7033/blackberry-and-almond-meringue-cake) with a meringue topping that was baked on top of one of the layers. Never made it but it sounds pretty good!

107,"Agreed with comment above.

I‚Äôll also throw in the theory that in addition to too much BP, the almond milk (less protein and fat than milk) and  the apple sauce (no proteins to coagulate) aren‚Äôt providing nearly enough structure to the loaf.

One possible solution: keep the almond milk but substitute banana in for the eggs?

Side question: Is apple sauce supposed to be a substitute to eggs?? Sounds fishy.

303,"Looks like a beautiful cake! However, you asked for feedback, so I'll give you detailed input (read: nit-picking).

Kudo's: the relief-work on the top tier is well done,  the pink flowers are lovely, the color scheme works out well, the changes in texture between the tiers works well, you've used just the right amount of decoration on the middle tier and your work is neat.

Points of improvement: the blue flowers look a bit unrealistic and don't really fit with the rest of the cake, I'm not a huge fan of the ruffles on the bottom tier (personal taste) but they are well executed, I think it would have been cooler with a gumpaste butterflies, and the ribbons on top distract from the beautiful flowers (I would have used big gumpaste roses in the ribbon's shade instead). 

Overall conclusion: it's a cake that's definitely good enough to sell and a piece of work that you should be proud of. The points of improvement are mostly details and some pertain to my personal taste. Also, some of my suggestions take quite a bite more time and doing that stuff is depends on the available budget.

1 1/2¬†cups¬†all-purpose flour
1¬†teaspoon¬†baking soda
1/2¬†teaspoon¬†salt
1/2¬†cup¬†unsalted butter room temperature
1/2¬†cup¬†firmly packed light brown sugar
6¬†tablespoons¬†granulated sugar
1¬†large egg
1¬†teaspoon¬†vanilla extract
2 1/4¬†cups¬†semisweet chocolate chips¬†(I think next time I would do half semi sweet and half milk)

Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F and line baking sheets with parchment paper

Sift the flour, baking soda and salt together and set aside 

In another large bowl beat together the butter and sugars about 2 minutes until smooth.

Add the egg and vanilla and mix on low until mixed in

Gradually add the flour mixture and mix in until just incorporated then add chocolate chips

Using an ice cream scoop drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets

Bake the cookies until the bottoms and edges are lightly browned and the tops feel firm when lightly touched,

Bake 10-13 minutes.

48,"That's a fair point - better to stop when you feel confident rather than add one more thing that you're not sure about.

If you were interested in doing it, any clean, new paintbrush in a size you're comfortable using is fine, but Wilton also sells brushes specifically for decorating, and some people are more comfortable with that.

You can use lustre dust or food colouring in whatever formulation you like working with best (or just have on hand). For food colouring, get it to the consistency and shade you want and just brush it on. I'd probably use a pointy brush and use it to deepen the angled end of the scales, or a wide brush to add depth to the broad end. I'd probably use gel that's been thinned a little, and I'd test it on a piece of fondant to get comfortable with the level of drag, saturation, and drying it'll need.

Ingredients:

* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (we use 70% cocoa), chopped into 1/4-inch pieces
* 4 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1 1‚ÅÑ3 cups granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 cup fresh Meyer lemon juice (from 3 to 4 lemons)
* 1/4 cup fresh orange juice
* Finely grated zest of 1 Meyer lemon
* Finely grated zest of 1/4 orange

Directions:

* 1. To make the ganache layer, bring 1/4 cup of the heavy cream just to a boil over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed saucepan.

* 2. Remove from the heat and pour in the chocolate pieces.

* 3. Swirl the cream around to distribute and cover the chocolate.

* 4. Let sit for 5 minutes, and then whisk gently to combine.

* 5. Scrape the ganache into the cooled pie shell and spread evenly over the bottom and halfway up the sides.

* 6. Refrigerate the shell to set the ganache while making the filling.

* 7. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325¬∞F.

* 8. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the eggs, egg yolk, sugar, and salt, and mix on medium speed until thick and well combined.

* 9. Stir in the lemon and orange juices and zests and the remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream and blend well.

* 10. Place the ganache-lined pie shell on a rimmed baking sheet.

* 11. Strain the filling through a fine-mesh sieve directly into the pie shell, or strain it into a separate bowl and then pour it into the shell.

* 12. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, rotating 180 degrees when the edges start to set, 15 to 20 minutes through baking. The pie is finished when the edges are set and the center is no longer liquid but still quite wobbly.",1,1521203863,2018-03-16

A little biscuit porn for any expat Brits in the sub. We made Bourbons with three fillings - classic chocolate, peanut butter, and matcha green tea. Hopefully the rustic nature of the filling will prove they're not just store-bought versions! 

Recipe below, full article here:
https://www.nerdswithknives.com/british-bourbon-chocolate-biscuits/

**Ingredients:**

*For the biscuits:*

* 140g all-purpose flour

* 40g corn starch

* 40g cocoa powder

* ‚Öõ tsp kosher salt or fine sea salt

* 110g unsalted butter, at room temperature

* 110g superfine sugar

* ¬º cup milk

* Sprinkling sugar

*For the fillings:*

* 3oz (half stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature

* 6oz confectioner's sugar *and either:*

* 3oz (85g) plain milk chocolate (50-60% cocoa solids) *or*

* 4oz (1/2 cup) smooth peanut butter *or*

* 1 tsp matcha

* 2 tsp milk

**Instructions:**

*To make biscuits:*

* Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicon mat.

* Sift the flour, corn starch, and cocoa together. Mix in the salt.

* Cream the butter and sugar together in a food mixer for 2 minutes until fluffy.

* Add in the flour and mix until combined.

* Add just enough milk to form a stiff dough ball.

* Roll the dough to ‚Öõ"" and cut or stamp into rectangles 60mm x 30mm or 2"" x 1"". Stamp if you like, or if not just prick holes across the biscuit with a skewer or fork.

* Add sprinkling sugar, if using.

* Preheat oven to 350F.

* Chill biscuits for 30m in fridge, then bake for 12-15m. Once baked, cool on a wire rack.

*To make filling:*

* Cream the butter in a food mixer until fluffy, and then gradually mix in the confectioner's sugar.

* If making the chocolate version, heat chocolate in a bowl over a hot water bath until just melted, then cool to room temperature. Add to the butter and sugar and mix until combined.

* If making the peanut butter variation, add the peanut butter into the butter and sugar.

* If making the matcha version, dissolve the matcha powder in the milk, then add to the other ingredients.

* Sandwich two biscuits together with a little of the filling, and store refrigerated until ready to serve. Biscuits should keep for 3-4 days.",5,1521209091,2018-03-16

You *might* be able to get away with this if you're using the Italian method which has a very stable meringue, but if you're using the French method you should be very gently folding in the almond flour + powdered sugar mixture as the meringue is quite delicate.

120,"The additives in the almond flour were almost certainly not helping.

If you Google ""macaronage"", you'll find plenty of tutorials that show the proper technique for incorporating the whipped egg whites into the almond flour.

Aging egg whites, from what I've read and experienced in my own macaron making, is unnecessary. It seems to be a leftover from when the eggs were whipped by hand. Today's high powered electric mixers can whip a freshly laid egg to stiff peaks with no problem.

Silicone mat, yes. Macaron pan, no (in my opinion). Learning to free hand pipe macarons is a great way to develop piping skills. It's not terribly hard after a little practice and if you're into baking you'll definitely find a use for those piping skills.

12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened, more for greasing pan
1 ‚Öì cups/166 grams all-purpose flour
3 ¬º teaspoons baking powder
¬Ω teaspoon kosher salt
¬æ cups plus 2 tablespoons/175 grams granulated sugar
3 large eggs, at room temperature
2 tablespoons whole milk
¬Ω cup/120 milliliters raspberry jam, more to taste
1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream
1 tablespoon confectioners‚Äô sugar, more for dusting
¬º teaspoon vanilla extract

PREPARATION
By Melissa Clark
YIELD 8 to 10 servings TIME 50 minutes, plus an hour's cooling
Victoria Sponge Cake
Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees and place a rack in the center. Grease and line the bottoms of two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper.

Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.

Step 3
In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until incorporated, then beat in milk, scraping down sides of the bowl as necessary. Mix in flour mixture until combined, then scrape into prepared cake pans, smoothing the top.

Step 4
Bake cakes until golden brown and springy, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, then unmold them onto a wire rack to cool completely, flat side down.

Step 5
Transfer one cake (the less attractive one) to a serving platter, and spread jam evenly on top. In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip cream, confectioners‚Äô sugar and vanilla just until it holds stiff peaks. Dollop about half the cream on top of jam, then top with remaining cake. Dust with confectioners‚Äô sugar and serve immediately, with the extra whipped cream on the side.",2,1521212926,2018-03-16

127,"Ahhh, this is super nostalgic. When I first started, I messed up the color of mine though xD

Not sure if aging is necessary, but making sure they're room temperature makes it easier to make the meringue! I second what other commenters said about being gentle with folding in the almond powder mix. My rubber spatula works wonders for me. I don't use a silpat (just parchment paper) or double up on my baking sheets (I only have a teeny electric convection oven to work with at the moment).

I've never tried using annin doufu powder, but it seems like the other ingredients in it probably threw the recipe off. I recommend almond powder/flour especially when starting out, though I've had varying amounts of success with other nuts, seeds, etc (hazelnut, pumpkin, sunflower, even coconut). As long as the fat ratio is similar to almonds (and doesn't have too many other additional ingredients), I've found that you can experiment a bit :)

Anyways, keep us updated! And as Francis from Cooking with Dog always said, g'luck in the kitchen!",4,1521213168,2018-03-16

Mistakes help us best in understanding stuff and learning from it after all.

Also: I made cinnamon rolls yesterday and forgot to take the seran wrap off before putting them in the oven... (they had to sit under it for an hour to rise a little more, and I had been in a hurry, the kitchen dark, didn‚Äôt want to leave the little kids unattended for too long, and in the oven it all went, because the wrap was stuck to the rolls so it was basically invisible...)",101,1521215024,2018-03-16
132,Luster dusts are great for adding dry on to fondant. I've done this a few times to add shading to my fondant work. You just need a dry brush and the dust which is like ¬£2 online. You can get shimmery  or matte ones. For using gel food colouring I have read you use vodka to thin it because it evaporates quickly off the fondant just leaving the colour. I haven't however put the latter technique into practice yet.,1,1521215178,2018-03-16

151,"The key to any Victoria sponge is to first cream the butter and sugar to a very fluffy consistency, then slowly beat in the eggs. Sometimes the egg addition can lead to curdling so you can add a little bit (teaspoon) of the flour along with the last few additions of egg to prevent this. The flour should then be carefully folded into the mixtures to avoid losing air. I usually use a large metal spoon to do this last stage. Don't use your electric mixer to mix in the flour or this will make it more like a pancake batter rather than loosely folded in flour.

The final mixture should be fairly soft, so that you can pour it into the pans then scrape the bowl and lightly level with the spatula, again being careful not to squash out the air.

The ratios I use are 100g each of Butter, caster sugar and self raising flour, to two large eggs.",2,1521218001,2018-03-16

273,"Parbake your pie crusts! That‚Äôs my advice. Any custard-type pie that bakes in the oven‚Äîpumpkin, sweet potato, Hoosier Pie‚Äîway too often call for the filling to go into an unbaked shell. The pastry dough you worked so hard to keep cold? Essentially stays raw and unbaked. Parbake it so you have the flakiness contrasting the smooth filling. 

I‚Äôm not sure steam will do much to help sponges. They have a high liquid to dry ratio and (usually in th US) depend on chemical leavening. Steaming bread helps delay crust formation, but also conducts heat into your dough, kicking the yeast/sour culture into high gear before thermal death plus quickening the expansion of gases. This next part is PURE CONJECTURE: My gut feeling steam would cause the outside of leavening in the outside of your sponge to over-react in relation to the interior. But I‚Äôm not sure. Why not try?! You‚Äôll either find it‚Äôs not worth the effort, gives AMAZING results, or goes down in flames. :)",2,1521237815,2018-03-16

Blood Orange Cream Pie
Yield: 1 9.5inch pie of deliciousness

**Ingredients**
**Blood Orange Syrup**
*425g blood orange rinds
*200g sugar
*Crumb Crust
*175g chocolate cookie crumbs
*75g powdered sugar
*90g melted butter
**Custard Filling**
*2 Tbs blood orange zest
*6 ea large egg yolks
*167g blood orange juice, rinds reserved
*1 Tbs vanilla extract
*595g sweetened condensed milk
**Blood Orange Chantilly Topping**
*4 tsp blood orange juice, cold
*1 tsp unflavored gelatin
*220g heavy whipping cream, cold
*110g blood orange syrup, cold
*1 vanilla bean, scraped
Procedure
1. Juice oranges and cut rinds into large chunks. Combine with sugar in stainless steel bowl.
2. Cover tightly and let sit at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for at least 3 hours.
3. While syrup is macerating, bake the pie.
4. Preheat oven to 325¬∫F.
5. Combine crust ingredients and press into a 9.5in pie plate. Bake for 10 minutes.
6. Whisk zest and yolks until lightened. Add remaining ingredients and whisk until homogeneous.
7. Pour into warm crust and bake for 14-17 minutes. Center should be set but still wiggle slightly. Return to wire rack and let cool to room temperature, before transferring to the refrigerator to cool completely.
8. While cooling, finish syrup by straining through a fine mesh sieve, then use citrus juicer or potato ricer to squeeze any extra syrup from rind chunks.
9. Measure out 110g for Chantilly, and refrigerate any leftover separately.
10. Make the topping: mix gelatin with cold juice in a small saucepan. When bloomed, heat over low until dissolved. Let cool slightly.
11. Combine remaining ingredients and whip at medium-high speed to soft peaks. Add gelatin solution and whip to stiff peaks. Dollop onto pie and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.",1,1521241155,2018-03-16

Add dry all at once, mix until flour is 90% incorporated, scrape the bottom and make sure no wet stuff is down there.
Add chocolate and nits if desired, barely mix.

406,"I'm no hero! I just thought that it'd get a few upvotes, some chuckles from the veterans, and maybe a helpful tip or two, so I'm legit overwhelmed by the response.

Macarons obviously aren't as easy as your average cookie because they do involve finesse and technique, but I think part of what makes them intimidating is that everyone loves to talk about how difficult they are, and how they fucked up their first through fifth times, and how even pro bakers make bad batches if they misjudged the humidity outside or whatever.

But you gotta remember that the cliche of ""cooking is an art, baking is a science"" is true, and science is all about the process (method). If you go through a process, you will get a result. Either it will be a good result and you have something delicious to eat and share, or it will be a bad result that shows you where your process went wrong and what to fix!

In my case I had two options as soon as I realized that my almond powder was 'impure': give up and toss everything, or go through with it and see what happened. Best-case I accidentally make something decent, worst-case I make something inedible but at least I can reflect on the process, understand what I did wrong, and learn from it! And that's true of any sort of creative endeavor.

In the end macarons are **goddamned cookies**, and you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by attempting to master them. Nobody will think less of you for getting it wrong, and this thread is proof of that!

Stores in the U.S. almost exclusively sell cardamom in a very fine powder form, but various ""ethnic"" dishes I've made call for crushed cardamom instead (e.g. Swedish, Finnish, and Indian foods). 

[I had no luck finding crushed cardamom here in Texas, so I ended up special-ordering it from a woman on Etsy who sources her supply from northern Europe. You can also crush your own, of course, if you can find whole cardamom seeds.]

I find that it makes a big difference to use the right type of cardamom in certain dishes, so that could be the case with your cake, too (although maybe not!). In any case, 1 teaspoon of powdered cardamom will have a much stronger flavor than 1 teaspoon of crushed cardamom, so it's good to keep that in mind as well.  ",1,1521301424,2018-03-17

Nutmeg or allspice are more the flavors I'd associate with Mexican chocolate.

However if I were you and wanted to try something with cardamom I'd look for a cardamom cake recipe with your general proportions and then maybe start with half maybe even a quarter of the amount of cardamom recommended and then go from there. You don't want to overwhelm the other spice.

Or you could just contact the bakery and tell them how much you miss the cake, rave about the cake and their bakery and then ask them for the proportions they used.  You can't ask for hints but you can ask outright and see if they'll help you.

If you recommend their bakery to people you are good for business.

As a celiac myself, I would recommend checking out a few recipes from Gluten Free on a Shoestring. She calls out the best flour mixture for each recipe, and has recipes to create your own blends from things like rice flour, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum, which you can often get at bulk food stores.

I was inspired by a post earlier this week by Emma's Goodies for a red velvet roll cake with pink hearts. It was so beautiful I just couldn't resist giving it a try.
I didn't really want to use the food coloring needed for that bright red look (Emma suggested using concentrated beet juice as a substitute) I ended up going a different route and did a white cake with pink hearts. I followed her recipe for the white cake (on her YouTube channel), and used the filling recipe and heart batter recipe from the red velvet roll cake. 
The filling required making some Raspberry jam, so I made a little extra and mixed some of it with the batter for the hearts, that's how I got pink hearts with no food coloring! yay!

All in all this was pretty simple, the frosting/filling is super yummy!!! cake is nice and light! Definitely want to do it again and play with different patterns. Thanks for the inspiration r/EmmasGoodies and r/Baking!",3,1518584876,2018-02-14

68,"Milk&amp;Cookies Cake

Cake ‚Äì 
2 ¬º cups flour
2 tsp baking powder
1 ¬Ω cups sugar
¬æ cup butter, softened
2 tsp vanilla
1 1/3 milk
1 cup mini chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350. Beat butter and sugar until combined and fluffy. Add in vanilla. Sift the flour and baking powder together. Alternate adding the milk and the flour mixture. Stir until combined. Sift the chocolate chips in with small amount of flour, just to coat to avoid sinking in the cake. Prepare 2 8in cake pans, divide the batter evenly, and bake for 30 mins. 

Cookie Dough Filling
¬æ cup brown sugar
¬æ cup white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2 tsp vanilla
2 cups flour
1 tsp salt 
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup mini chocolate chips

Cream together the butter and sugars. Add the vanilla and salt. Slowly add the flour (if you are worried about eating raw flour, you can bake it for 10 mins in the preheated oven, then let it cool before using). Once the ingredients are combined, gradually add in the heavy cream until combined, then increase the speed to get it up to a light, whipped texture. Add the chocolate chips. 

Sweet Cream Syrup
1 cup heavy cream
¬Ω cup brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla

Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the sugar is fully dissolved, then let cool.

Chocolate Ganache
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup chocolate chips (I used Ghiradelli)

Heat the heavy cream until just about boiling. Pour over the chocolate chips and let sit for a minute before stirring until smooth. Definitely recommend using high quality chocolate here! 

Buttercream Hybrid Frosting
5 Tbsp flour
1 cup milk
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 cup powdered sugar

This is a hybrid of the best frosting in the whole world, Frosting That Will Get You Hugs, by The Girl Who Ate Everything (original blog here). Slight variation is to hold up to the heaviness of the ganache and decorations in most of my recipes. Still very light for an icing recipe. 

Heat the flour and milk in a saucepan until a roux forms (you want thick, batter like consistency. Let that cool. While cooling, cream together your butter and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Once the roux is cooled, add the vanilla. Then add the entire mixture to the butter/sugar, and whip on a high speed until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and slowly combine, then give it one last minute of high speed whipping and you are good to go. 

Instructions:
Make the cake. While it is baking, prepare the syrup. After you remove it from the oven, pour the syrup over to really let it sink in. Let cool. 

Make the cookie dough frosting, then grab about 1 cup of it and set aside to make the decorative cookie dough. Add in ¬Ω-1 cup of powdered sugar until this mixture is moldable for whatever designs you want to make. Make the buttercream hybrid. 

After your cakes are cool, remove them from the pans and get stacking. Layer them with the cookie dough frosting. I went really heavy, to get almost even layers of cake and frosting, but you should have plenty to work with. 

Crumb coat with the buttercream hybrid, then pop it into the freezer for a quick set. Wait 15 minutes, remove, and ice the cake smoothly with the buttercream hybrid.  Set it back in the freezer and prepare your ganache. 

Once the ganache is at a good slow drip consistency, pour it around the edges to get the drip effect (I used a piping bag, but you can do it with a spoon or a bottle, whatever you prefer). Use the remaining buttercream and the stiffened cookie dough frosting you set aside to decorate. I sprinkled a few of the leftover chocolate chips on, just for fun.

1.  I made cream cheese vanilla bean cutouts and chocolate cutouts.  The chocolate ones are a smitten kitchen recipe (brownie roll-out cookies).   

The cream cheese ones are as follows:
1 lb unsalted butter
1 lb cream cheese
675 grams granulated sugar
2 large eggs
30 ml vanilla bean paste
10 ml vanilla extract
5 ml almond extract
950 grams all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

2.  I made ‚Äúpaints‚Äù out of Americolor gel food coloring by mixing about a tablespoon of color with ~4 ounces Everclear alcohol.  Let it sit overnight, then strain through a coffee filter and those are your paints.  You can dilute them further with more alcohol when you paint them on.

If anything is too warm, then it flops.  

It's super easy to fix this though, so don't give up or throw it out!  Pop the entire bowl into the fridge for 10-20 minutes to let it cool down, then re-whip it, and it will magically come back to life.

It's a very forgiving frosting, so never give up!

Also! I learned that if the butter splits or curdles then that means the mixture is either too warm or too cold, it's usually too cold in my experience from the butter not being soft enough. When that does happen I take a hot cloth and hold it against the outside of the bowl and it will slowly come together.

I‚Äôve been told to never go higher than medium speed when making buttercream, and if mixing at medium speed, keep it as short as possible. I also do the viva paper towel trick. Pop it in the fridge for a few minutes, grab one of the smooth viva paper towels and a fondant smoother and run them around the cake. That helps quite a bit and if you need to sharpen the edges of your cake, you can do that with the paper towel as well! ",3,1518622067,2018-02-14

193,"**Christmas pudding**

Christmas pudding is a type of pudding traditionally served as part of the Christmas dinner in the UK, Ireland and in other countries where it has been brought by British emigrants. It has its origins in medieval England, and is sometimes known as plum pudding or just ""pud"", though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving dried fruit. Despite the name ""plum pudding,"" the pudding contains no actual plums due to the pre-Victorian use of the word ""plums"" as a term for raisins. The pudding is composed of many dried fruits held together by egg and suet, sometimes moistened by treacle or molasses and flavoured with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and other spices.

225,"Sure! It's a cinnamon ermine buttercream. You can make a custard for this, but the easiest (and what I do) is buy ready made vanilla (or whatever flavor) pudding.  For a standard batch that covers 40 plus cupcakes, I use 20oz of softened butter, and 2 and 1/2 cups pudding. While the butter in a stand mixer on medium high for about 5 minutes, until light and fluffy. Then turn mixer to low and add the pudding until just incorporated. Then turn mixer back up to medium high until it's nice and fluffy. During this phase you can add food coloring and other flavors. This frosting tends to be a lot less sweet than traditional American buttercream, so if you like it sweeter you can add some powdered sugar.",1,1518628414,2018-02-14

Ingredients:

Red Velvet Cake:

280g Soften Butter/Baking Spread

250g Caster Sugar

1 Tsp Vanilla Extract

3 x Eggs

250g Self-Raising Flour

3 Tbsp Cocoa Powder

¬Ω Tsp Bicarbonate Soda

200ml Buttermilk

2 Tsp Red Food Gel

Pipeable Cream Cheese Frosting:


250g Soften Butter

700g icing Sugar

360g Full Fat Cream Cheese

2 Tsp Vanilla Extract

1. Pre heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4. Place the soften butter/baking spread and caster sugar into a large mixing. Mix the ingredients until they become paler in colour.

2. Next add the vanilla extract and mix again. Add the eggs one at a time while mixing (this will prevent the mixture from curdling)

3. Add the red food gel into the mixture and mix until all of the food colouring has been evenly incorporated.

4. Place 1/2 of the self-raising flour, 1/3 of the cocoa powder and the bicarbonate soda and mix then mix until the ingredients are incorporated.

5. Then add 1/2 of the buttermilk into the mixture and mix again.

6. Repeat this process until all of the dry and wet ingredients have been mixed in.

7. Divide the mixture into 3 x 20cm lined cake tins and bake for 20-25 minutes.

8. While the cakes are cooling make the cream cheese frosting. In a large mixing bowl place the soften butter and mix until the butter becomes paler in colour.

9. Next add the icing sugar and mix until all of the icing sugar has been incorporated.

10. Add the cream cheese and vanilla extract and mix until you get a pale white frosting. Then place the frosting into a piping bag fitted with a Wilton Large Round Tip.

11. Place one layer of cake onto a serving plate and then pipe the cream cheese frosting onto the red velvet cake.

12. Repeat this process again for the second layer.

13. Repeat this for the third layer.

330,"I over mixed my batter on the first attempt, it turned out really flat but it formed a bit of foot and it was a bit grainy. Make sure to pulse your almond flour and confectionery sugar in a food processor for 16-20 times and then sieve it. I also had issues with my oven on my 2nd attempt the bottom turned a bit brown but not  burnt so I lower the temperature for 259f instead of 300f but it really depends on your oven. I used 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar I find it easier to form a skin when you let your macarons rest. Make sure you count the times you mix the batter. I mixed it 30-35 times and that works for me. I've tried different recipes but this recipe that another redditor shared to me worked out well. It's a small batch too it's not too bad if you failed making it. Good luck!

352,Have you ever had it before? My parents always used on make it and it was very *moist*. Not enough to leak uncontrollably but enough that a bit leaks out when you cut into it. I've had it since moving away and everytime it's so under saturated that it feels like a normal cake that's a bit more wet than normal. ,2,1518651604,2018-02-14
353,Maybe there was some grease? I‚Äôve found that any slight hint of grease (or sometimes excess water from condensation or w/e) can keep the whites from forming stiff peaks. I make sure to wash the bowl and whisk twice and dry it thoroughly before I make SMB,1,1518651786,2018-02-14

382,"Yes. I'm familiar with Kook-e-King machines.
The key to making it work, is using a soft dough, you might need to add water to your cookie dough to give it desirable machining characteristics.

 If you add ingredients to your dough it would be best if it's kept small, about the size of 4000 count Choc Chips.

Also when cutting the cookie, make sure when the cookie falls, the heaviest side falls first, this will help prevent cookies from flipping after they have been cut. ",2,1518662291,2018-02-14

492,"I think popping the dough in the freezer will definitely help unify the shapes (although they're generally gorgeous) but the butter's temperature won't affect spread in cookies.

Cookies have such a large surface area, the butter will melt quickly in the oven regardless of the dough's temp before it goes in. The amount of butter to flour ratio does affect spread, however, so minding your baker's percentage in regards to butter and flour will change your spread. Acidity of the dough is also a big factor in spread but adjusting this also affects color which can be an issue in sugar cookies.

133,"I used a variant recipe that‚Äôs a little more spreadable than the traditional kind but you still have to work fast.

1/2 cup of butter 
1 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup of milk
2 teaspoons vanilla 

Sift together 

2  1/4 cups icing sugar
2/3 cup of cocoa powder 

Bring the butter and milk to a very low simmer, stir in sugar until it starts to dissolve- whisk until it doesn‚Äôt feel grainy. Add vanilla and remove from heat.

Carefully pour warm but not boiling butter mixture into the sifted dry ingredients and mi with a large spatula - have the cake ready to be iced and immediately start icing it. 

This stuff will set quickly and it‚Äôs not very moveable once it‚Äôs on, so be mindful of placement. I like to work on the top first and then the sides just because the smaller surface of the sides is more forgiving.

Refrigerate or freeze before baking.

Be certain oven is fully preheated before loading cookies.

If you want, you can use a food thermometer to determine if they've reached the minimum safe internal temperature.

356,"So it was largely Gordon Ramsay's recipe for which there's a YouTube video. But I made adjustments so here's my recipe. Measurements are based on metric volume or weight cause that's how his video goes.

480 grams bread flour

50 grams semolina (optional, I like it)

15 grams dry yeast (2 packets of Fleishmans)

300 ml of warm water

50 ml olive oil

Salt and pepper to taste (I would say like a teaspoon and a half of salt, not sure about pepper but I used multicolored pepper)

Also I added fresh thyme to the dough, maybe 2-3 teaspoons

Combine the flour, semolina, yeast, salt, pepper, and thyme in a bowl. Pour the olive oil on top of the warm water in a pouring measuring cup. Swirl it together and add it to a well in the center of the flour about 1/3 at a time. I used my free hand to mix it in the bowl while I poured with the other hand. Knit it together until the dough comes together but will still fall apart if you hold it up. Flour a work surface and kneed the dough. I'm new to cooking for the most part so I just went until the dough was smooth and formed it into a ball. Let it rest in a bowl greased with some olive in a warm place for about an hour.

In the pan you want to cook it in, put some olive oil down with some salt and pepper. I wanted a bit of texture on the bottom so I did a weird thing. I combined a couple tablespoons of bread crumbs (panko was all I had) and a bit of semolina and sprinkled it in the bottom of the pan. Push the dough into the bottom of the pan, once it's in the corners push down with your fingers to the bottom. I cut sun dried tomatoes and a clove of garlic into thin strips and put them into some of the dents I made in the dough. Pour some olive oil on top of the dough, salt and pepper the top (kosher salt is good for the top and bottom so you get the burst of saltiness sometimes). Pick some fresh rosemary leaves and sprinkle them over top. Let the dough rise again in a warm place for about 20-30 minutes. Bake at 400 F for about 30 minutes.

I do a lot of embellishment when I cook, feel free to simplify the recipe or change up the toppings. I've done kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes before and that's a good combo.",3,1516092077,2018-01-16

472,"Old Fashioned Lemon Tea Cakes

Tea Cakes
3 3/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
1 cup granulated sugar 
2 large eggs
Zest of 2 lemons
1 tsp lemon extract
2 Tbsp buttermilk

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Sift the flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg into a medium bowl (sift twice), set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the lemon zest and lemon extract, mix to fully combine. Add the dry ingredients in 3 additions alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being sure not to overmix. Dump the dough on to a lightly floured surface and shape the dough into a large ball. Divide the ball in half. Place each half on top of a sheet of parchment paper. Place another sheet of parchment paper on top of each half. Using a rolling pin, roll each half out into a 1/4 inch layer. Place the rolled dough on a sheet pan. Repeat this process with the other half of dough. Place the sheet pan in the refrigerator and let dough chill at least 2 hours. 
Working with one rolled sheet of dough at a time, remove the top layer of parchment paper. Using a cookie cutter, cut out the dough and place on a parchment lined sheet pan, ~2 inches apart. Bake the cookies until they have puffed up and are lightly brown around the edges ~8-10 minutes. Place on a cooling rack to cool completely.

Lemon Glaze (optional)

1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
Zest of 1 lemon
3-4 Tbsp fresh lemon juice

In a medium bowl, whisk together all ingredients until smooth. You may need to add more lemon juice if the glaze is too thick (if needed, add more lemon juice 1 tsp at a time). Dip the cooled cookies directly into the glaze then place them on a cooling rack until the glaze is set. You can also spoon the glaze over the cookies, using the back of the spoon to spread the glaze into an even layer.

Chilling the dough helps cookies keep their shape.  Roll the dough and then chill the whole thing.  (Too hard to roll chilled dough that is in a ball.)

Cut your shapes as close as possible so you have less scraps to reroll, leading to tougher cookies.  Depending on the size of the recipe, I only roll out part at a time.

I usually have better luck doing one sheet at a time in the oven.

Run your cookie sheet under cold water (and dry it!) before reusing, or the heat could cause your cookies to melt.

But I stink at baking, and I can't make anything look good.  But my siblings still have that baker bug.  

I will never be able to make anything like this.  But I look at it and think about how cool it is.

189,"I challenged myself this holiday season to make 12 different ""cookie"" recipes in December. So far this has been my favorite! If you're interested in watching me make them I have a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/9USxqkHgiOw) showing you exactly how I put them together, if not the recipe is below.

Christmas Tree Cakes 
(yields about two dozen cakes)

Cake Ingredients: 5 Egg Yolks, large 8 Egg Whites, large 2 ¬º c Cake Flour, sifted 1 ¬Ω c Sugar 1 Tbsp. Baking Powder 1 tsp. Kosher Salt ¬æ c Water ¬Ω c Vegetable Oil 2 tsp. Vanilla Extract, clear

Preheat oven to 325* F. In a large bowl mix sifted flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add oil, water, egg yolks, and vanilla extract to the flour mixture. Mix just until everything is combined; do not over mix. In a separate bowl beat the egg whites with a mixer. Beat the egg whites on high until stiff peaks form. Then, gently fold the egg whites into the rest of the cake batter. Pour into a lightly greased and parchment lined jelly roll pan (be careful not to overfill the pan, a thin layer should do the trick.) Tap the filled pan gently on the counter to release any air bubbles. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. When your cake is completely cooled, remove it from the pan by running a butter knife along the sides and flipping it over on a wire cooling rack. Peel off the parchment paper and slide the cake back in the pan. Use a cookie cutter to cut out tree shaped cakes.

Filling Ingredients (7 Minute Frosting): 1 ¬Ω c Sugar 1/3 c Water, cold 2 Egg Whites, large ¬º tsp. Cream of Tartar Pinch of salt 1 tsp. Vanilla Extract, clear

In a metal bowl combine the sugar, water, egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, then set the bowl over the boiling water to create a double boiler. Then, beat on high speed for about seven minutes or until the frosting is stiff and glossy. Remove from heat, add the vanilla, and beat for an additional 2 minutes. Use immediately. Spread a thin layer of icing on one cake and place another on top.

White Chocolate Coating Ingredients: 2 12oz. bags of Candy Melts, bright white 1 12oz. bag of Candy Melts, Red 8 Tbsp. Vegetable Shortening Green Sugar Sprinkles

Prepare one bag of candy melts at a time. Combine 1 12oz. bag of bright white candy melts with 4 tablespoons of vegetable shortening in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave on 50% heat. Every 30 seconds check the chocolate and give it a good stir.
First dip the sides of each tree cake into the chocolate. Make sure it‚Äôs coated thoroughly, and then let it harden on a wire cooling rack. Once dry, use an offset spatula to carefully release the tree cakes from the cooling rack. Then, dip the top of each cake into the chocolate. Try to get a smooth layer. After dipping each cake, immediately dust them with green sugar sprinkles. In a microwave safe dish melt the red bag of candy melts using a microwave on 50% heat, checking and stirring every 30 seconds. When the chocolate is melted add it to a decorating bottle, and carefully squeeze four lines on each cake to create garland.",1,1513446628,2017-12-16

210,"I will second a good quality stand mixer, but have included some items that are quite budget friendly--except the last item I suggested. :)

A kitchen scale if you don't have one. Weighing your ingredients is way more accurate than relying on volume. 
An oven thermometer, then calibrate your oven when you get it. This will help with under or over-bakes that are the fault of your oven (all residential ovens are off somewhere). Maybe you set your oven to 350*F and that's what the thermometer reads when you have it in the middle or on the right front, but maybe it reads 362*F in the back on the left. Good to know when you are baking so you can make adjustments. Source: This is my oven. 
A quality candy thermometer would come in handy if you ever make a Swiss or Italian Meringue Buttercream OR Marshmallows OR Caramel, you get the idea.

These are inexpensive, but my very favorite type of spatulas. https://www.amazon.com/Bekith-Pack-inch-Silicone-Spatula/dp/B00PGZ9XRA/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513449809&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=one+piece+silicone+spatula  The one piece design makes clean up so easy and they never break in half (I think I have 12 or 13 now. I use them for everything from baking to cooking. It would be hard to live without them.

Pure vanilla extract or pure vanilla bean paste. I love Nielsen Massey--&gt;  https://www.amazon.com/Nielsen-Massey-Madagascar-Bourbon-Vanilla/dp/B003L259AU/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513449284&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=vanilla%2Bbean%2Bpaste&amp;th=1  OR, cheaper per ounce, but tougher to shell out all at once depending on your budget)  https://www.amazon.com/Nielsen-Massey-Vanillas-Madagascar-Bourbon-Vanilla/dp/B0000W0GQQ/ref=sr_1_12_s_it?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513450101&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=vanilla+bean+paste  In case you didn't know, the bourbon has to do with the type of vanilla beans they use, not booze.

It really showed me the importance of proper technique, though Bogan's carefree attitude helped me realize it's also not all about precision and has to do with feel, especially with respect to time pressure. 

I really must disagree with the comments about their feedback. If anything, I've learnt a great deal about desserts being something beyond sweetness, the value of presentation, and some interesting tips in preparation from their comments. I'm a novice, but I thought their commentary was pretty strong all around.

I took a small knife and drew out the pumpkin in the dough and then separated it in segments so you could see more definition after the bake. The leaves were just a long tedious process of hand cutting and scoring dough. 

If I were to do it again, I think I would add the egg wash to the pieces before placing on the pie. I was so scared to sink the pumpkin and some leaves that they ended up getting a very light coat. You can see the color change because of it. ",2,1510852097,2017-11-16

184,"Yes! I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry if my formatting is off. All measurements are by weight. 

8 oz sugar 
2 oz water
3 oz egg yolks
10 oz butter, room temperature and cubed
.12 oz vanilla extract (or any flavor you like. I used blackberry pur√©e until I liked the taste)

1. Combine water and sugar in a sauce pan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Once it‚Äôs boiling, don‚Äôt touch it! You can brush any sugar crystals on the side of the pan down with a wet pastry brush. 
2. Start whipping your egg yolks once the sugar reaches about 200*F. Whip them until they are thick and light. 
3. When the syrup reaches 240*F, remove from the heat and pour in a thin stream into your egg yolks, whipping constantly. Try not to let the stream hit the whip, because it will crystallize instantly. 
4. Whip until thick, light, and completely cooled down. 
5. Add the butter one piece at a time, whipping until completely combined. Switch to the beater attachment once about half the butter has been added. 
6. When all the butter is added, you can add any flavorings or colorings you like.

445,"Yay another baking bride!! :D

Here is [my tiered wedding cake!](https://imgur.com/gallery/zE2ZV)  Flavours in imgur description.

My suggestion is to bake ALL your cakes one week to 5 weeks in advance. Wait for them to cool (you can speed up the process by covering them with a damp paper towel and putting them in the fridge). Then you flip the cake so it's dome side down (I used bake-even strips so mine didn't dome too much). You double wrap them in saran wrap, and put them in a large zip lock bag (or airtight plastic bag), and put them in the freezer. Do not stack more cakes on top until it's completely frozen. I think I made around 130 servings, and I needed almost all the freezer space.

I transported each tier separately to the venue the night before the wedding, then they sat in a fridge until my friend arrived a couple hours before our ceremony to stack them for me. I saved large cardboard boxes to serve as sturdy cake boxes for transporting my 5 cakes. If you are able to, I think it would be even better to freeze each tier for half an hour or so before you stack them, and then you would be even less likely to smoosh the frosting! :D ",2,1510942103,2017-11-17
446,Thank you! Yep they're just sugar cookies!,25,1510942550,2017-11-17
447,I would think so but I wouldn't make it too far in advance ,1,1510943406,2017-11-17
448,"I bake as a hobby, and made [100 cupcakes](https://imgur.com/a/tEIbu) for a sweets festival this summer, so hopefully you'll find my tips helpful!

I recommend making everything that you can ahead of time, so bake the cupcakes and frost them all today, then store them covered in the fridge (they took up almost all my fridge space).  
Make all the decorations too today and store them separately in tupperware. But I would be cautious about putting decorations on top until tomorrow, because some decorations don't hold well (for example, coloured sugar and sprinkles will absorb moisture and bleed into the frosting).  

I transported my cupcakes to the venue in 2 cake carriers that I already own and several sturdy cardboard boxes.

As you can see in my photos, I used cardstock cupcake liners.  The downside is that they're more expensive than normal liners ($2 to 20 at my local dollar store), and they need more cake filling to look nice.  But the upside is that unlike normal paper liners they are very balanced, so there's no risk of cupcakes falling down in transport.  They are also taller so there is much less risk of frosting touching each other or decorations falling down because it's all contained by the cup.  

Good luck!!",4,1510943433,2017-11-17

I actually don't like very decorative top crusts because 1) You end up with chunks of crust that are too thick and are unappealing, 2) it doesn't bake evenly so you get portions that are under baked and portions that are practically burned, 3) the second you slice into it, it cracks apart and looks terrible.

Anything more complicated than a simple lattice top might look pretty, but it negatively affects the eating experience of the pie, and honestly, that's the only part that really matters.",10,1508211506,2017-10-16

**Ingredients**
140g (2/3 cup) softened butter
280g (2 1/4 cups) icing (powdered) sugar
2 tablespoons milk
food colouring (if desired)

**Preparation method**
1. Beat the butter in a large bowl until soft. Add half of the icing sugar and beat until smooth.
2. Add the remaining icing sugar and one tablespoon of the milk and beat the mixture until creamy and smooth. Beat in the milk, if necessary, to loosen the mixture.

It's probably more than you need, but 20-30 minutes that many recipes say isn't really long enough.

Wednesday- I pick out the recipies Im going to use and go pick up any ingredients I need. 
Thursday- I would prep the shell ingredients. Weigh out your 1:1 almond flour/ powdered sugar mixture, sift it, and place each separate batch in its own ziplock bag. Separate your egg whites and leave them out at room temperature until bake day. 
Friday- Make all of your fillings for the macarons. I prefer ganache fillings in my macarons, it also freezes quite wonderfully. 

One last thing... I would definitely go with a Italian or Swiss meringue recipe for your shells. It is way more consistent and durable then the French method, especially when your making hundreds of cookies in a day.

281,"So my roommate‚Äôs girlfriend really likes Harry Potter, so I decided to bake a butterbeer cake recipe I found online. Cake turned out pretty good, although it‚Äôs a little dry. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what went wrong for it to be so dry. The recipe called for mixing all the wet ingredients with the butter and brown sugar until no streaks of liquid remaining, but that just wasn‚Äôt happening, so maybe something went wrong there? The batter turned out to be a little thick compared to the other cakes I‚Äôve made in my painfully amateur tenure as a baker. 

I‚Äôll try to post a picture of the inside later if y‚Äôall are interested. 

Here‚Äôs the recipe. I followed it pretty much to a t, except for the butterscotch flavoring. I used Silver Cloud Butterscotch flavoring, just because it was more readily available. I also used cold, large eggs, while the recipe calls for room temperature, XL (or L) eggs. Don‚Äôt know how much of an effect that could have. Like I said, painfully amateur.

Could be the cold eggs, or you just didn't mix it long enough.  It takes quite a long time even on med-high speed.
To warm up your eggs next time, just put them in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes or so.

306,"To get clean cuts with a dessert like this, there are a handful of simple techniques they may have used. Using a sharp blade without serrations and a single fluid motion (going back and forth with leave lines or smear a little) is a good way. Having the dessert be very cold, sometimes even froze if that won't harm the recipe helps. 

Lastly restaurants sometimes will heat their knife to help slice through a cold dessert easily. Sometimes you'll see bakers with a knife that is dark and burnt looking because it is a dedicated slicing knife heated with a kitchen torch. Another heat method is to dip your knife's blade in boiling water for 10 seconds or so, then carefully wipe the water away and slice. Between each cut clean the knife so the next slice does not get messy.

Oh and don't forget, if this is not a real item served and just for the picture, people will do crazy things to get a perfect picture!

There are probably several other ways to cleanly cut a dessert, but I hope this was helpful. ",5,1508351481,2017-10-18

382,"When you serve butter cakes straight out of the fridge, it tastes dry because cold butter is hard.  Leaving the cake out the fridge for 30minutes or so will fix it.  You can definitely store butter cakes in the fridge (just make sure it's in an air tight container or covered completely in buttercream).    

You might notice that a lot of grocery store bakery cakes tastes just fine when cold, that is because they tend to be made with oil or shortening, which doesn't become hard when cold.

Going back to your original question about eggs, I found this interesting info on why room temperature eggs is so important:

It‚Äôs also super imperative for eggs to be at room temperature when the recipe calls for it. A lot of this is because of air bubbles again. When you beat or whisk an egg, the egg‚Äôs protein traps the air bubbles. And while baking, the bubbles expand in the heat of the oven. And, again, air bubbles expanding = lighter textured baked good. Air trapping is at its peak when the eggs are at room temperature. Ever notice that it‚Äôs much quicker to whip, beat, or whisk eggs when they‚Äôre room temperature? They come together so much easier and actually whip to a higher volume! That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre more loose, for lack of better words.

The whole air trapping business isn‚Äôt the only reason why we use room temperature eggs in baked goods. Adding cold eggs to a room temperature fat (like creamed butter and sugar) could shock, harden, and curdle that fat. This would ruin the creamed mixture, the entire base of your recipe. If you bake the recipe with this ruined creamed mixture, you‚Äôll have a bunch of little holes in your cupcakes from the hardened butter pieces. Don‚Äôt sabotage your recipe!

[Link](http://atreatsaffair.com/pumpkin-cheesecake-bars-recipe/)

    Crust
    1 1/2 cups graham crackers crumbs
    1/4 cup melted butter
    Filling
    4 packages (8 oz each) cream cheese , softened
    1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
    4 eggs
    1 cup (8 oz) canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix)
    2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
    Garnish
    whipped cream
    pumpkin pie spice

Instructions

    Heat oven to 300¬∞F.
    Line a 13X9 baking pan with parchment paper leaving about 1 inch of paper hanging on the sides.
    In a medium size bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter.
    With your fingers press the crust on the bottom of the prepared pan. Set aside while making the filling.
    In the mixing bowl of your stand-up mixer , add the cream cheese and sugar. With the paddle attachment on, beat on low speed until light and fluffy.
    Beat in eggs, one at a time, just until blended.
    Spoon half of the mixture over the crust and spread evenly.
    To the remaining cream cheese mixture add the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice.
    With a wire whisk stir until smooth. Carefully, spoon over mixture in pan.
    Bake the cheesecake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes or until just set. Turn off the oven and leave the door ajar allowing the cheesecake to slowly cool down for about 1 hour or so.
    Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before cutting into bars.

38,"Generally speaking wedding cake slices are cut at 1"" x 2"" (in Canada anyway).   I have seen fruit cake cut smaller at 1"" x 1"" due to richness and heaviness. 

If fruitcake is a norm and will be eaten by everyone, opt for a larger slice.  

A 6/9/12 combo will give you 130 1x2 slices including the top, remove 18 from that since you intend to save the top.  So 112 slices. 

8/11/14  gives 185 - 32 for the top = 153 1x2 slices. You would probably have to make a 12"" layer and cut to size. 


In my experience 15% or so don't eat cake. I normally tell my brides that if there are other desserts out at the same time as the cake you need fewer slices.  

Go with your gut. If you know people will eat it or don't mind being stuck with lots of leftover then go larger.  You don't want to run out of cake either.  

Also think about how much you want to save for yourself. Fruitcake is not as easily eaten as spongecake.  Is having a 8x8 or even a 6x6 going to be too much? Being so heavy, what is your plan for it?  Is it a 1st anniversary dessert, or to have around the house for a party. Don't get me wrong....I love the stuff, but an 8x8 lasts my family of 4 the whole Christmas season.  

For 150 1x2 slices with a top layer being saved for anniversary I tend to recommend a 4/8/10/12 combo.  For 2 people a 4x4 top layer is perfect to keep for later. 

Good luck, and feel free to ask any questions!",3,1505648259,2017-09-17

47,"I followed the method for chiffon cake here: https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/06/skyscraper-cakes/. To get the basil flavor in, I put about 1/4 cup of basil in a food processor with the sugar and whirred it all around until it was bright green and kind of moist, then used the sugar as directed. 

After baking I soaked the cake in basil simple syrup. 

The lemon curd was the filling from this tart: https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/02/whole-lemon-tart/. I followed the method up until you're supposed to put it in a tart shell, then cooked the custard in a double-boiler until it hit 180¬∞F. Then I ran it through a sieve to get out all the lemon chunks. 

The frosting was also pretty much as-written, but I had to do it in two batches because of my mixer. I subbed an equivalent amount of lemon extract for vanilla.

145,Yeah I thought about using a bread knife to try to level it out but opted on trying to press it flat with a cutting board but the dang thing sprung back up. What exactly is a crumb layer?  Like crumbed cake?,1,1505690612,2017-09-17
146,"Nice color, although for my tastes, I would cut the frosting by 2/3rds so that it's not three times thicker than the cookie.",5,1505690693,2017-09-17
147,"pressing it definitely isn't a good idea, for one as what happened to you it just sprang back up! ahah. But also it can really ruin the texture of a cake.

A crumb layer is a layer (or layers) of frosting/ cream/ whichever you use to partly cover the cake before putting on the final layer. It's traditionally done to prevent crumbs breaking off and mixing into the final layer, stopping it having a clean and polished look. But it can also help with adherence of other layers and decorations.

153,"Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake 

Crust:
6 oz pecans
2 cups honey graham crackers
.5 tsp cinnamon
.25 cup of brown sugar
1 egg white, beaten 

Filling:
4 eggs
3 egg yolks
2.5 lbs of cream cheese 
1 cup dark brown sugar
.5 tsp salt 
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 
1 teaspoon fresh ginger
.25 teaspoon ground clove 
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
1 cup heavy cream 
1 tablespoon vanilla extract 
1 pound pumpkin puree 

Salted Carmel Drizzle:
 1 cup sugar
.33 cup water
.5 teaspoon sea salt
.75 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsalted butter 

Prepare the crust:
1. Line a ten inch springform pan with foil to prevent leaking while baking. 
2. In a food processor, combine pecans, graham crackers, cinnamon, and sugar. Process until a fine crumb is formed. Add in egg white and blend until a crumbly paste is formed. 
3. Grease the foil in the pan and press the crust into the bottom and slightly up the sides. 
4. Prebake the crust for 10 minutes at 375 degrees. Allow to cool to room temperature. 

Prepare the filling:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine brown sugar and softened cream cheese until smooth. 
2. Add in the eggs slowly, until smooth. Add in spices, cornstarch, and salt.
3. Add in remaining ingredients, taking care to not over whip air into the filling. 
4. Pour into prebaked crust and bake in a water bath first at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, and then at 300 for 50-60 minutes. Cheesecake should still have a slight wobble in the center.
5. Allow to cool in oven for two hours with door cracked, then move to the refrigerator for at least four hours. 
6. Remove from pan and foil. 

Prepare Salted Caramel Drizzle:
1. Mix water and sugar together. 
2. Hear over medium heat without stirring until deep golden.
3. Remove from heat and add cream. Beat until smooth.
4. Add butter and salt and mix
5. Allow to cool before drizzling over cheesecake. 

Serve cheesecake with fresh whip cream.

Tips:
- Do not overbeat ingredients. You will over incorporate air and end with an overly airy texture and poor structure. 
- Lining with foil is optional but allows for a clean removal of final product.

Looks like this is your problem. Measuring flour by volume can differ by as much as 50%, especially in a recipe like this.

Skilled bakers can adjust a dough to the right consistency using their experience, but until you become more familiar, I suggest you buy some scales and build up your confidence with successes rather than winging it and hoping for the best.",3,1505722484,2017-09-18

303,"**Connecticut Field pumpkin**

The Connecticut Field pumpkin is a type of pumpkin. It is an heirloom variety, the ""standard"" and ""classic"" pumpkin, ""one of the oldest pumpkins in existence"". Widely used for autumn decorations, either whole or as jack-o'-lanterns, it is also suitable for culinary purposes. Said to differ little from squash grown by Native Americans in pre-Columbian times, the name ""Connecticut Field pumpkin"" references the area where the ancestral variety was found, as well as the traditional system of planting pumpkins in corn fields.

As for where to get decorations, bulk food stores often have a lot of cake decorating ingredients and equipment. Also party stores and craft/hobby stores.

I was pureeing both kinds of squash, one for pie and one to add to my senior dog's food to get her to eat and I licked the spoons and thought, you know, pumpkin actually tastes like shit, that's why we add all the spices and sugar and only use it in a few things aside from baking where it's got all that spice and sugar. Meanwhile butternut is fucking delicious and already has a sweet flavor to it. I tried making one of each pie that year and they tasted almost identical after the spice, but the butternut tasted sweeter, so I cut the sugar in the recipe way down and switched to pureeing a butternut instead of a pumpkin and the family is not the least bit bothered and is eating slightly less processed/added sugar, so it seemed like a pretty good swap.

423,"Here is the recipe if anyone would like to try and make it!

Ingredients:

Cake:

150g Soften Butter/Baking Spread

400g Caster Sugar

4 x Eggs

75g Cocoa Powder

260g Self-raising Flour

75ml Milk

9 Tbsp Boiling Water

1 1/2 Tsp Baking Powder

Raspberry Syrup:

100g Fresh/Frozen Raspberries

75g Caster Sugar

90ml Water

Raspberry Buttercream:

250g Soften Butter

800g Icing Sugar

350g Fresh/Frozen Raspberries

Decoration:

1 x Portion of Chocolate Ganache

Fresh Raspberries

1. Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4. Place the softened butter/baking spread and sugar in a large mixing bowl and mix until the mixture becomes pale in colour.
2. While the mixture is mixing add each egg one at a time to prevent the mixture from curdling. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix again.
3. Next add the self-raising flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, milk and boiling water. Mix until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.
4. Next transfer the mixture in three 20cm lined cake tins. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes.
5. To check if the cake is cooked place a skewer in the middle of the cake, if the skewer comes out clean, then the cake is baked. Place the cakes on a cooling rack and leave to cool for 30 minutes.
6. To make the raspberry syrup, place the water, sugar and raspberries and heat until the mixture starts to boil. Then remove the mixture from the heat.
7. Next sieve the mixture to remove the raspberry seeds, leave the syrup to cool.
8. While the syrup is cooling make the raspberry buttercream, place the frozen raspberries in pan and heat. While the raspberries are heating up break up the raspberries using a wooden spoon. Let the raspberries simmer for 10-15 minutes, the raspberry puree should thicken up to form a jam-like consistency.
9. Remove the raspberry puree from the heat and pour the mixture through a sieve to remove the seeds. There should be around 150-180ml of the thicken raspberry puree, leave the puree to cool for 30 minutes.
10. In a large mixing bowl add the softened butter and mix until the butter becomes paler in colour. Next, add the icing sugar and mix until the icing sugar has been incorporated.
11. Slowly add the raspberry puree into the buttercream mixture; you may not need to use all of the raspberry puree. Keep on adding the raspberry puree until you get a spreadable buttercream.
12. Place one layer of cake onto a cake turntable and then brush the raspberry syrup over the cake. Place some buttercream over the cake and place the next layer of cake on top.
13. Repeat this process again for the final layer of cake.
12. Next coat the cake with the raspberry buttercream, I have a tutorial on how to do this here. Then place the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes.
13. To make the chocolate ganache, break up the chocolate into small pieces and place into a bowl.  Place the cream in a pan and heat till it starts to simmer. Pour the cream over the chocolate and mix until all the chocolate has melted. Leave the ganache to cool for 15 minutes.
14. Remove the cake from the fridge and then transfer the chocolate ganache into a squeeze bottle (these bottles are good for drip cakes as it makes it easier to control the length of your ganache drips).  Squeeze the ganache over the edge of the cake to create the drips and then with the remaining ganache over the top of the cake.
15. Leave the ganache to set for 20 minutes, meanwhile place the remaining buttercream into a piping bag with a Wilton 1M Open Star Tip. Pipe buttercream rosettes around the edge of the cake.
16. Decorate the cake with the fresh raspberries.

481,"An approximate recipe since I don't really follow one when I make cheesecakes. This is a no-bake one. 

Base: 300g Digestive Biscuits Crushed

150g Unsalted Butter

Filling:

300ml Double Cream

100g Icing Sugar

450g Cream Cheese

1tsp Vanilla Extract

1tsp Lemon Juice

200g White Chocolate

Fresh Strawberries cut in half to cover the biscuit base. 

Strawberry Jam/Syrup thing:

300g Chopped Strawberries
120g Sugar
1tsp Lemon Juice
1 Leaf of Gelatin

Decorations:

Piped Sweetened Whipped Cream

White Chocolate Stars 

White Chocolate Drizzle

Chopped Strawberries covered in more Strawberry Syrup. 

Method:

1. Crush your biscuits til fine, then mix with melted butter. Let chill in fridge.

2. For the filling, whisk together the icing sugar and double cream until you get a soft peak consistency. Then whisk in your cream cheese, vanilla, lemon juice. 

3. Melt 200g white chocolate, let it cool a bit and then fold into your 
cheesecake filling. Let chill for 10 minutes in the fridge. 

4. Strawberry jam : It might be easier to just heat up some strawberry jam with a lil water and use that, come to think of it. If you wanna do what I did and do it the stupid way, just throw your chopped strawberries, sugar and lemon juice in a pot with a tablespoon of water and cook it over a medium heat for a long time until you get a jam. Then add your bloomed gelatin. 

5. Pour half your filling into the springform tin, drizzle with some strawberry jam. Pour the other half of the mix in. Make the top even, then back in the fridge overnight.

6. Decorate how you see fit!

Line and grease a 7‚Äù cake pan. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine 75g cup sugar and scant 1 tablespoons water in thick bottom pan or pot, and stir until the mixture looks like wet sand. Cook over medium-high heat, gently swirling the pan occasionally but not stirring, until light amber, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and quickly but carefully pour the caramel into your 7‚Äù cake pan. Next, arrange the peaches in concentric circles over the caramel. Drizzle with the bourbon, sprinkle with cinnamon; set the skillet aside.

Whisk the flour, ground pecans, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat the butter and the remaining 50g cup sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy.  Add egg and beat on medium-high speed again for a couple minutes, then beat in the vanilla and 1/2 tbs bourbon. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour mixture, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour, and mix until just incorporated. Pour the batter over the peaches and spread evenly.

Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35-45 minutes. (Cover loosely with foil if the cake is browning too quickly.) Let sit 15 minutes, then invert onto a platter and let cool completely.",1,1503022115,2017-08-17

18,"Definitely start with simple easy classic bakes! Don't be too ambitious to go immediately for frostings etc.

I would suggest you start with the good old classics that are popular and delicious, yet look great. For example, Brownies, Muffins and Cookies.

As you gain more confidence on the basics on mixing and understanding instructions, you can try working with buttercream or royal icing. They are both very malleable and forgiving for the beginner. 

If you need recipes you can feel free to check out my blog as http://Lebakeomaniac.blogspot.com . I specialize in making recipes and tips for beginners.

54,Ugh that's so much extra effort/wasted cake but still really want to make a cake like this. ,3,1503048666,2017-08-18
55,"I would say honestly, it is not easy ( correct me if I am wrong by the way ). The cakes look impressive, but beneath that beautiful surface, is a lot of efforts and patience put into practicing and making these cakes. You can't expect to perfect and replicate these cakes that you see in Bakeries, Instagram, Pinterest etc overnight ( unless you're a talent! ).

Please be patient with yourself! Failure is subjective in this case because you might have done well as a beginner, but failed compared to what you are seeing from around you. 

I would advice you like what Shaematoma said, set a crumb coat before setting it in the fridge. Apart from that, research via books or the internet to see what you should and can do in for cake decoration. For instance, the evening out of the layers of the cake before setting them for the assembly. 

Apart from which, other tips include having a cake stand or a make-shift cake stand, along with bench scrapers for cake decorating. These two tools help me a lot. A LOT. At least when I was starting out on cake decorating!

66,"oh, and offset spatula! The rotating cake stand, bench scraper and offset spatula makes a big difference. I'm only an amateur, and it's just a hobby. But when making layered cakes, I learn to spread out what you have to do over a few days, rush jobs always mess up my cakes. 

So I'd bake one day, make frosting/buttercream one day, make filling one day (if I do a different filling like fresh fruit curd or mousse) then assemble the day before the event. 

Keeping your cake cool, and chilling the cake after applying crumb coat will definitely help your cake to be sturdy, before putting final buttercream coating and decorations.

90,"Hi Reddit! Hopefully I am posting in the correct subreddit. So I have been a big fan of madeleines ever since I had them three years ago, and have wanted to bake them, but due to my ~~busy life~~ unrivalled laziness, I didn‚Äôt. But last week, I finally got off my lazy bum and bought a madeleine pan and ingredients as per the recipe here: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/9954/french-butter-cakes-madeleines/, and baked my first ever madeleines. They weren‚Äôt exactly good, but after trying twice more, I was able to bake the perfect madeleines ‚Äì soft, airy, with crunchy shell with a little bud on top. 

The problem was, all my attempts afterwards were a flop, and I have no idea why. There are few things that I am not following as per recipe: the amount of sugar (I put in half the amount, as I found the amount written in the recipe to be far too sweet), lack of lemon zest, just flouring the pan instead of buttering and whisking after adding in flour to get rid of the flour chunks, but would something like this make madeleines come out like the picture I attached? I originally baked madeleines at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes, but now I am finding that even if I bake them for 17 minutes (maximum duration in the recipe), they still come out looking/tasting raw. 

I should mention that I am completely new, and this was my first attempt at baking anything (I didn‚Äôt even know how to whisk eggs properly until yesterday), so I will likely be unfamiliar with baking terminologies. If possible, I would really appreciate it if you could explain things like I am 5. I really need your help here reddit ‚Äì I love madeleines, and I don‚Äôt want to have any more of this raw pastry.

131,"Not sure I can help you with the shortening taste (the vegan butter recipe linked by /u/queeniebelle seems like it'd be delicious!), but looking at your croissants, I think that your shortening melted into your flour; I'm not seeing good lamination like you should have with this kind of pastry. 

Which recipe were you following, and how closely was it followed? That's not a dig at all, I'm curious as to the process it says. 

Usually, you want to make your fat super cold, get your first couple turns done before it warms up, then fridge it for a long while till the fat re-chills, then lather rinse repeat a few more times. If the fat warms up, you won't get layers and it'll soak together to make a biscuit-like dough. Which is, I think, what I'm seeing. 

It's a problem I had for ages with my pie crust pastry (slightly different construction, but same basic idea). It was so super frustrating to see the recipe pictures resulting in these decadent, flaky crusts and mine looked like a $1 frozen chicken pot pie crust. I started cutting all my fats up into little cubes and popping 'em into the freezer for about an hour to make sure they're icy cold. Works like a charm these days.",6,1503092938,2017-08-18

(Ignore the washer and dryer in the background)

I had been wanting to make some French bread for the longest after I saw a recipe for it in the Better Homes and Garden Cookbook, and I figured I'd go ahead and make some Honey Wheat Bread while I was at it.

[French Bread Recipe.](http://www.bhg.com/recipe/rolls/french-bread/) 

[Honey Wheat Bread Recipe.](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/6773/simple-whole-wheat-bread/) 

Both were pretty easy to make. The wheat bread took a lot longer than I expected, thankfully I started on it first. Proofed took about 2.5x longer than the recipe stated, and I discovered a new trick based off of a comment on its recipe (apparently long proof times is common with the recipe). You can get your dough to proof faster if you run your dryer for about 15 minutes, put the bread in the dryer. The residual heat helps it rise faster. [Looks funny](http://i.imgur.com/hF2s92I.jpg) but works like a charm.

I was using the ""two sheet"" method, so I removed the bottom extra sheet and everything is all better again.

The batter is on the chocolatey bitter side because I want the cocoa powder to stand out without being a shadow of large amounts of sugar. I would suggest you to up the amount of cocoa powder by 1-2 tablespoons in order to make the chocolate taste even more distinct :) 

Also, don't over bake it so that the red will still be vibrant and will not be tending towards brownish maroon.

For cake decorating specifically, and techniques in general, it's helpful to watch things. Youtube has plenty of how-to videos. You can learn a surprising amount from the Great British Bake Off if you're able to watch for the right thing. 

If you're mostly interested in frosted cakes, focus on finding basic cake and frosting recipes you love. There's a surprising variety of buttercream frostings. My favorite is flour/ermine frosting, but there's also swiss, italian, american, german, french etc. ",2,1503193664,2017-08-19

379,"Proofing is the time when the yeast and bacteria in your starter metabolize (ferment) the starches in the dough. The products of this fermentation are an assortment of acids, esters, volatile aromatic compounds, as well as CO2. It is these things that give flavor, aroma,  and resistance to spoilage to your bread. Rush this step and you ruin your bread. It will become more like the horrible, flavorless factory bread that people buy from stores and it will go stale much faster. All of this is why I choose to use a ""wild"" starter culture (levain) rather than commercial yeast, but it still applies to breads baked with commercial monoculture yeast. This is because there are yeast and bacterial contaminants in store bought yeast, in the flour itself, as well as from your own hands. These, to varying extent, are also active when baking with commercial yeast. Bottom line is- do not be in a hurry.",2,1503199558,2017-08-19

As for mushy peaches, yes, once you cook them they will be softer.  Perhaps using peaches that are just about to be ripe?

In terms of a substitute for the cooking beans, I'm not too sure. I haven't made a pie crust before but I do know it's important to have something on top to make sure it doesn't puff up. You could use a pan but I don't think it would be heavy enough to keep the pastry from puffing up. It would be handy to use rice, if you have it lying around. Maybe google cooking beans substitute?

Maybe try different scoring across the top to get a greater amount of oven spring. One thing I did wrong when I was starting out was doing really light cuts.

29,"I have a handheld too. 

So basically a genoise recipe requires you to start by beating the whole egg with the white sugar - classic recipes say to submerge the egg and sugar mixture in a warm water bath for the first 5 min to increase the amount of air incorporated, but with a handheld mixer I find it unnecessary. Usually it takes about 15 min on high, until the mixture is light yellow, fluffy, and when you drizzle ribbons of it on the surface, it stays for quite a few seconds before disappearing. 

At this point you can gently fold in the flour (and salt) in increments. You can sub in some cocoa powder for flour for a chocolate genoise. Some recipes call for melted butter at this point, but I omit that. You can also add other flavourings, like vanilla extract, but I don't think this matters because you are going to have to soak the sponge anyways with some kind of flavourful liquid afterwards. Important thing is just to be gentle to avoid deflation. ",3,1500439320,2017-07-19

Ingredients
150g caster sugar
150g plain flour
150g ground almonds 
140g cold cubed butter 
1 egg, beaten
200g raspberry jam

Method
Mix the sugar, flour, and almonds in a bowl.
Add the butter and rub the mixture until you get a breadcrumb texture.
Add the egg and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together, then knead into a ball. 
Weigh the dough and remove a quarter of it for the lattice topping, flatten the rest of the dough until about 1"" thick and place in a 9"" tart tin. 
Press the dough a bit up the sides of the tin, then add the jam as evenly as possible. 
Roll the dough that you set aside earlier into a long rectangle (about 1/8"" thick) and then cut into strips. Make a lattice with this dough on top of the jam. 

Bake at 190 Celsius/375F for 30 minutes. 
Cool in the tin for 5 minutes then slide onto a serving dish

For my espresso powder I use https://groceries.morrisons.com/productImages/280/280072011_0_640x640.jpg?identifier=da514f3de08253878b9f07769623078e

**Coffee meringues (make in advance, they keep!)**

110g egg white, 200g caster sugar, 2tsp instant espresso powder, 1/2tsp cream tartar.

**For the cake:**

Grease and line 3x 8 inch cases.
Oven at 160C for a fan oven

 This makes way too much batter. I think you can safely reduce all of these ingredients by about 25%.

* 320g butter
* 320g self raising flour
* 320g caster sugar
* 320g eggs
* 110g ground walnut
* 2tsp baking powder
* 2tbsp instant espresso powder

Divide by the three tins. Bake until done (~20-30 minutes).

**Candied walnuts - make whilst the cake bakes**

http://natashaskitchen.com/2014/01/11/5-minute-candied-walnuts/
I used half the recipe there.

**Decorating**

When they're cool, trim them flat and then fill and cover with espresso buttercream (250g butter, 500g icing sugar and 2tbsp espresso powder - but add gradually and taste!)

Chill in the fridge as you want the icing cold for the drip.

For the drip: 200g dark chocolate, 20g butter, melt it all together and let it chill until getting gloopy. Pour on. Decorate quickly with walnuts and meringues.",2,1500474870,2017-07-19

136,"Onward to the recipe!

Overall Difficulty: 1/5 ( Suitable for beginners )
Time Taken: Less than an hour ( inclusive of mixing the batter, mashing bananas and baking time )

Ingredients Required:
- 1 cup of all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup granulated white sguar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- mashed bananas ( I mashed about 2 medium sized ones, using a fork to yield about 2/3 cups of mashed bananas )
- 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla essence or 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup of butter, softened at room temperature
- 1 egg ( mine weighs 55g including the shell ), at room temperature

Method:
1) Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C or 350F. Line the base of your 8 x 8 inches baking tray with parchment paper or grease it well.
2) Cream together the softened butter and the two sugars.
3) Add in the egg, mashed bananas, vanilla and salt and stir until well combined.
4) Add in the all purpose flour and stir until just combined. Do not over mix or your blondies will have bread-like consistency.
5) Bake for about 22-24 minutes or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.
6) Cool for about 45 minutes before cutting. You can cut them just like how you would cut cakes, and do not need to employ any special techniques unlike for the cutting of brownies.

Notes:
They can keep well for up to 3 days at room temperature in an airtight, dry container. They're best kept in the refrigerator but might become slightly hardened due to the solidifying of butter.

I would recommend to eat them as soon as possible as fruits are good source of medium for bacteria growth! Don't want to be shocked by the appearance of fungi growing on these bananas!",6,1500482381,2017-07-19

163,"Ooh, this reminds me of a cake I did for one of my friend's bacheleorette party. https://m.imgur.com/gallery/33hSr

Some suggestions, echoing what others have said: 

‚Ä¢ bake in stages so it's less overwhelming. I tend to make mistakes when I get tired and frustrated. Expect to spend more time than what you budget especially if this is the first time. Bake the cake one day, let cool, then wrap in plastic wraps and freeze. Make filling a different day, place in fridge. Make buttercream and place in fridge. 

‚Ä¢ On the day you assemble, plan ahead to take buttercream to room temp - it takes a few hours. I usually store buttercream in ziploc bag, flatten it as much as you can. It will be easier to get it back to room temp than a big block of buttercream. 
Rewhip buttercream before using.

‚Ä¢ if filling is somewhat lose, do a buttercream dam. Pipe buttercream on the edges of the cake prior to putting the filling, to prevent filling leakage.

‚Ä¢ after crumbcoating, I would put the cake in the fridge for a bit to harden the crumbcoat. It will make it easier to apply the buttercream later and also prevent the filling from leaking and get lopsided from the weight of the cake

‚Ä¢ I like infusing my cake with simple syrup or liquors to introduce some additional complementary flavors to my cake and keep the cake moist. For raspberry chocolate cake, you could do chambord.

‚Ä¢  use parchment for the bottom of your cake pans and butter them well. It is very disappointing to spend time making your cake batter, watching it bake only to watch it fall apart because it didnt come out cleanly from your cakepan.

‚Ä¢ Some tools will help you on assembling and decorating cakes. The rotating cake stand offset spatula are great tools for applying buttercream. To make smooth buttercream on the sides, I use a bench scraper.

167,"Read through all your recipes for the cake layers, filling, buttercream and schedule out your plan and familiarize yourself with the recipes, visualize what you are going to do step by step. Make sure you have enough of each ingredient. 

Filling can probably be made the day before, and same with cake layers. If you need butter to be at room temp then plan to take it out the fridge an hour before you need it. Always give yourself plenty of time since mistakes happen and a rushed cake is not a happy cake! 

Don't over mix your batter, mix just until ingredients are combined (in most cases). Except for creaming butter and sugar - mix that until it's super fluffy. Note that different recipes will have different batters, some more liquidy than others, so there's no real guideline for batter consistency, just pay attention to the recipe you're using.

Cake is almost done baking when your house smells like cake! Take a peek when you're at the lower end of the bake time range, if the cake sides are starting to come away from the pan sides and a toothpick comes out clean you're done. Cake should also feel springy when pressed lightly with a finger.

Parchment rounds lining the bottom of your pans is key. Butter and flour your pans too. Dome tops are fine, the scraps from levelling are a good opportunity to check the taste of the cake.

Get a big offset spatula if you don't have one already, makes frosting a lot easier. ",3,1500497484,2017-07-19

Personally, I am able to get those through a baking / supplier store near my house but I don't think it would be useful telling you the store name since we live in such different areas!

Personally, I would still choose gallon bags over them despite having both available to me. This is because those bags are air tight and can store food better, especially since this trip will probably take multiple days (?). 

If they are to be made in more accessible and easier to be served, perhaps they can be packed in smaller ziploc bags in the serving sizes your friend desires, for your friend's preferred consumption!

I am pretty ignorant of how long the road trip is and hence how to store the food. But here's an idea you might want to consider!

You can perhaps label the food with the priority it should be eaten in. For example, since cookies are drier in nature, are more likely to store better and longer, and can be labeled of a lower priority. In this sense, your friend will know what should be consumed first, while ensuring there's enough food and snacks along the way :)

Swiss is dead easy if you have an induction burner or something else that can hold a precise temperature - throw your egg whites and sugar in there, heat and stir to 155, making sure all the sugar is dissolved, beat until cool and then add butter until is comes together.

French is the same, but you use yolks. For an amazing chocolate frosting, once everything is dissolved and up to temp, throw in some chocolate chips and let them melt before beating and adding the butter.

Italian is faster, but you've got to boil a sugar syrup and then pour it into beaten whites which can get fiddly.

It's less sweet than American buttercream and carries flavors SO well. I mix powdered freeze dried fruits into mine for macaron fillings, it's fantastic.

432,"You could make a dark chocolate ganache, composed of high cocoa percentage dark chocolate and cream.

I sometimes make an easy one which is about 150g of 70% cocoa chocolate and 150ml of double cream. I have a lazy method where I put the cream in a glass jug and briefly heat it in a microwave. then I break up the chocolate into small pieces and add it, along with about 1 teaspoon of golden syrup (or any invert sugar would do instead, but might change the shine). then I keep microwaving for short times (eg. Ten seconds) and then stirring and repeat this until it forms a shiny smooth emulsion.

You can vary the quantities to change the final consistency. In general this is a very 'forgiving' recipe. If the ganache begins to get too hard you can just stick it back into the microwave for a few seconds and stir vigorously (I used this to coat the top of mini cupcakes for a wedding and there were many reheatings before I got them all finished!)

For something fruity and simple, you can try these banana blondies. They're really forgiving for the beginner as well and takes less than an hour to make!

Here are some Oreo Stuffed Fudgy Brownies ( that are not too fudgy, but also chewy at the same time ). You can omit the oreos if you do not like them and the brownies still come out really well.

Once the pan is gunk free, dry it with a paper towel.  Then you'll need to reseason it a couple of times so that it's non-stick.

89,"They look really good. That browning on the shells should be easy to adjust. 

There is a macaron shop near me called Sugar Fix√© that does seasonal mint chocolate chip macarons. They look like [this](https://media.timeout.com/images/102051161/image.jpg) (front and center). They put the mint extract into the macaron shell rather than the chocolate. 

I think they are the best mint and chocolate macarons I've ever had. Putting the mint into the shell itself lets the chocolate ganache really stand out, and it gives you that mint and chocolate flavor throughout the entire bite.

Here's a link to the recipe: http://kirbiecravings.com/2012/05/nutella-shortbread-cookies.html

My changes to the recipe are as follows: When I refrigerate, I don't roll it out to 1/4'' thick, but just in a large ball. Afterwards, I roll it out to roughly 1/8'' thick, then cut into shapes using my ""N"" cutter. I try to use up all of the dough this way, and last night, when I was finishing this bake, I ended up making a few very thin ""N""s as a way to use up the dough.

100,"Sugar in the raw behaves way differently than brown sugar. Brown sugar contains a good amount of molasses, and has much smaller sugar crystals. I'd try again using brown sugar; the molasses content helps make cookies softer.",4,1497893478,2017-06-19

I do use app flour instead of the mix suggested but otherwise I follow it as is. 

I think brown sugar has higher moisture than sugar in the raw. That might impact the overall moisture content of the dough as well.

I also find the consistency of the butter when you mix the dough make a difference when they go into the oven. Usually after making the dough, I scoop them into individual balls and place them in the fridge for at least a couple hours or up to a day. Then bake them straight from the fridge.

This is also a good trick if you want to make a large batch and bake only the amount you want/need. I freeze dough balls and they last for months. Cant beat freshly baked cookies!!",1,1497893843,2017-06-19

Also, I think what you mean by the liquid having grounds in it might be due to an uneven crumb coat. In order to get a great mirror glaze, I'd imagine you have to have a perfect crumb coat on the cake before glazing. Any kind of mirror glaze will just enhance the imperfections in the frosting.

Then add the melted dairy and stir. Heat until  240 to 245deg on a candy thermometer.

Also, from my experience making jam, blueberry jam made with ripe blueberries doesn't contain as much pectin as raspberry jam.  That makes it a bit thinner and more likely to seep and mix with other ingredients.  What happened with your cake seems typical of blueberry jam.",9,1497940529,2017-06-20
207,"You think? It's 2:30 and it was a long day and it's hard for me to know if I'm thinking about this right or not. I definitely think it could be the jam seeping, because there's no sign of the grayish color anywhere else except immediately under the jam layer. And I noticed the blueberry jam was a lot thinner than the raspberry jam. But at the same time I'm so worried about risking it because I wanted to bring in some cake for my co-workers, and the last thing I'd want is for anyone to get sick.

Edit: Idk if they'd be considered low sugar or not. I used a 12oz bag of frozen fruit for each, and then I cooked them on the stove with I believe a cup of sugar each, as well as some lemon juice and light corn syrup. The blueberries weren't releasing juice the same way the raspberries do so I also added a splash of water to them.",1,1497940739,2017-06-20

But I've made an awful lot of jam in my time.  Blueberry is always thin... if you scoop some out of the jar the hole quickly fills up with liquid, much more quickly than with other jams.  It's a bit badly behaved.

If I need it to be stable for a cake I might cook up some blueberry jam with a bit of corn starch to make it more stable.  Or I would just expect it to seep and not worry too much.

I seriously doubt a few hours out of the fridge on a cake would be dangerous to consume.  Just a bit unsightly.

Also... I bet exactly the same thing would have happened if the cake had been in the fridge.  Blueberry jam is just like that.

They see homemade cookies as some god-tier level of voodoo that requires blood sacrifice. What takes us 10 minutes with a memorized recipe for requires a day of planning and a stained 3x5 from Aunt Myrtle's arcane tome of heirloom recipes for them. It's just not easy for some folks.

307,"Yes I do! It's SO much fun to make--please follow-up with me so I can see how yours turns out!

If you want to buy the dough and have fun with it, buy biscuit dough (2 cans worth equals the recipe below, more or less), and the instructions are the same minus the dough making part.

If you want to make the dough, see below!

**Dough**

1 1/2 cups warm water

2 tablespoons sugar

1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)

2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

3 3/4  cups all-purpose flour, add small amounts as needed

Vegetable oil (or EVOO)

**Dough Coating**

Melt 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter and put in a bowl

2.25 cups of sugar

4 tablespoons of cinnamon

**Instructions**

Warm water (think mildly warm cocoa, NOT hot!) and add in yeast/sugar/salt. Let sit for 3-4 minutes.

Mix in flour 1 cup at a time. You might not need it all--use your judgment. The dough should be soft like play doh, but not overly dry.

IF YOU WANT--use WHOLE milk or Heavy Cream in place of water for even softer dough with more flavor--but totally up to you, water works fine and dough is great.

Gently knead the dough for 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl and cover w/saran or a lid, let rise for 60 minutes or until doubled.

Remove dough from bowl onto a lightly floured surface (just so it doesn't stick if your kitchen is warm and the dough is a wee bit too sticky.

Cut small chunks of dough out--think about the size of an oreo...although you can really do this part however you prefer size wise. 

Melt the butter into one bowl and have the sugar and cinnamon mixed together in another.

Dip the dough globs in butter, let them drain off (so they're coated but not still dripping butter) and roll around in cinnamon sugar. 

Line either a bundt pan, pop-out cake pan, or square pan with them (be sure to spray it down nicely first!). Make sure it‚Äôs high enough, or you don't stack the dough too high because this WILL double in the oven. This can make 2 layers in a cake pan and they will double in size while cooking. You don‚Äôt want them to overflow.

Bake at 350 until browned, which can be hard to tell since the cinnamon sugar will darken as it bakes (30-45 minutes‚Ä¶this really depends on how high/thick you pile it, the type of pan, etc‚Ä¶there‚Äôs going to be some subjective judgment here), just don‚Äôt burn it or undercook it! You will have to use your judgment or get creative with a long knife and cut into the center a little after 30-35 min.

Personal example: Using a pop-out cake pan and two layers of dough, mine took approximately 45 minutes (I checked it several times) at 350 degrees.

Be sure to check at least once to ensure the top doesn‚Äôt brown too fast and burn‚Ä¶if this happens, cover it loosely with tinfoil.

LASTLY, if you use a pop-out pan, place a sheet of foil under it (or a pan) as both times I did that, some of the butter/sugar found its way out while baking and dripped onto the oven floor.

Remove from oven and let cool, then feel free to frost or top it with anything else, really.

You can get super creative and stuff the dough globs, too! Chocolate chips, peanut butter, nutella, meat/cheese, etc. You can make all sorts of monkey bread variations.

And they are a BLAST to make!

371,"If you have a favorite brownie recipe, use that. Just dollop some jam around on it and marble it with a butter knife or a toothpick (be careful not to scratch your pan if using the knife.) You could also add about 1/2 of your total batter to the pan, then dollop some jam around, add the rest of the batter (I'd place in some bigger scoops/spoonfuls of batter so it doesn't cause the jam in there to mix in or spread around too much), then dollop on however much additional jam you'd like and then marble the whole thing a little. Same for the PB ones. Just make sure to keep an eye on them since the extra sugar from the jam might caramelize a little faster than the batter bakes. Also, if your recipe uses the toothpick test (not too common for brownies, but some recipes do use it) remember that the jam could affect the way the pick looks coming out. (Something that may look slightly wet might actually be perfectly baked, just a little wet from the jam.)

Honestly, the taste reminds me of waffle cones--it's malty-caramelly, sweet but not overpoweringly so, and with a lovely toothiness and savoryness from the cornmeal. It's a perfect coffee/tea cake. I received a marriage proposal from this cake, so it's something.

**Molasses Cornmeal Cake**

* 2-3/4 cups (330g) all-purpose flour
* 2/3 cup (75g) yellow cornmeal
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 6 large eggs
* 1 cup (200g) white sugar
* 3/4 cup (160g) dark brown sugar, packed
* 3/4 cup (170 ml) buttermilk
* 1-1/2 cups (300 ml) light olive oil
* 1 T (15 ml) molasses
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon orange (or lemon) extract

1. Preheat oven to 325 F and spray a 12-cup bundt pan with non-stick spray. Combine flour, cornmeal, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Set aside.

2. Combine buttermilk, olive oil, molasses, and extracts together and set aside.

3. Combine eggs, sugar, and brown sugar and mix with a hand mixer or whisk attachment on a stand mixer at medium high speed until mixture is lightened in color to a pale yellow, about 2-4 minutes. 

4. Slowly add wet and dry ingredients to mixture, alternating between wet and dry. Mix until combined.

5. Pour batter into prepared bundt pan and bake for 35-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

6. Cool in pan for 15 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack and cool completely.

7. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired. ",4,1498069181,2017-06-21

Cream of tartar is not 100% necessary but it will make a slightly lighter meringue.  It's an acid and acids help the whites whip up.

From the internet

""Acids allow more air to be beaten into a meringue. In order to make meringue, the proteins in egg white must be denatured. In their natural state, the proteins are curled up into tightly packed balls. When the egg is beaten, they uncoil into long strands.

These strands then begin to coagulate, or join together, with the help of the sugar you add. The air you whisk in gets trapped between these joining strands, giving the meringue its characteristic light texture.

Acid delays coagulation, which means that there is more time for air to get trapped in amongst the proteins, resulting in a lighter meringue.

The acids usually added to meringue are white wine vinegar, lemon juice, or cream of tartar. Fresh eggs are more acidic than old ones, so these help too.

Some cooks use copper bowls to make meringue, because copper ions from the bowl bind to a particular protein (conalbumin) and strengthen it.""

But my stepmom loves meringues and has made them for years without the addition of an acid.

The most important things are 

A very, very clean glass or metal bowl and beaters.  Anything oily will prevent your whites from rising well.  That also means no yolk at all in the whites so separate your eggs carefully.  And no plastic bowl or utensils since oils cling to plastic and you can't really get rid of them.

Superfine sugar will dissolve in the whites more easily and you won't have graininess.  You can make your own in the food processor if you can't find it in the market.

If you're making French meringue you want to whip your whites to get them frothy and then start slowly adding the sugar a spoonful at a time, add and whip in, add and whip in.
The weight of the sugar granules can pop the egg white foam.  So do a little at a time.

You can pipe it or just dollop it using spoons on your nonstick baking sheet, sil-pat or parchment paper.   

Use the lowest setting on your oven.  You're not really baking them you're drying them out.
My stepmom turns the oven off and leaves them in it overnight.

Hope that helped.",1,1498096642,2017-06-21

- Was the dough really cold when you put it in to bake? Sometimes really cold dough won't spread as much, I believe (although no certain) it's because the oil in the dough (usually butter) takes longer to melt and spread.

- Oven temperature too low. Double check what temp you set your oven to, and if there is still an issue invest in an oven thermometer to make sure your oven isn't lying to you

Savoury baked good are amazing. Try making savoury muffins or mini-loaves, and tweak and tinker with your recipe. Use cottage cheese instead of butter one day, or yogurt. Cheese, no cheese, veggies, bacon, mince. 

You can also pass the time by focusing on decoration. Bake a generic batch of cupcakes, freeze some, then every day take one or two out and spend some time decorating it and making it look incredible (using fondant and piping etc etc). 

You can also work on making a decent loaf of bread.

You can get the wings a smoother surface by placing parchment on top and heating lightly with a blow drier and using something fly to apply light pressure.

326,"My advice would be there doesn't seem to be enough air in the dough. I usually knead in my kitchen aid,  but kneading by hand should be about 10 minutes. Also check your kneading technique, you want to be pushing the dough away from you with the heel of your palm, folding it back over, turning and starting the process over.

Also watch the rise of the dough, overdoing it can also kill the yeast. Make sure you prove bread twice, as this adds more air to the dough.

Other general tips are make sure any water you use isn't hot (it kills the yeast), warm will do.  Ditto salt, be sparing with it. Additionally,  put a tray in the bottom of the oven and fill it with hot water prior to baking your bread. It gives a crunchier crust.

Good luck and keep at it, it will come together :)

Don't go by recipe rise times - go by volumes. If your dough needs to double in volume, let it double, even if it takes a couple of hours.

385,"thanks for the recipe! AND yay for breadmaking. Good luck, its very rewarding and fun and everyones got to start somewhere.

So its a pretty inaccurate recipe overall.... directions wise and also with the amount of flour... a cup is a lot to leave ???s around. There is also a huge ratio of yeast.. but to be honest, it looks like with your loaf that it just doesnt have enough structure. 

SOOO this could be to do with yeast --- I would never ever add salt to my yeast activating mix. Salt retards yeast. If you add it in immediately it will affect the capability of the yeast and its rising action. Maybe try adding it with flour next time.

Also 20 mins is so short for a rise. leave it longer, cover in damp tea towel. Id leave bread ambient proofing for up to 1 hr, maybe more depending on recipe!

Goooood luck!

I cant see you getting much help with coconut water as a soak... coconut MILK maybe... but youd be better off making a rosewater syrup and soaking rather than in the batter, imho.

If you want to include coconut, I would recommend making a coconut cream icing as a filling and having strawberries running through that. You could use a vanilla clotted cream type thing (how are you making this icing?) for the outside. best of all worlds.

420,"The Beanilla pistachio extract isn't bad, but quite close to almond extract. Still looking for the right pistachio.

I'm fairly happy with Watkins for peanut, hazelnut, strawberry, and coconut (which McCormick also does well) and,  most of all, caramel. Their cherry didn't quite satisfy me so still looking.

Which LorAnn oils do you like, and which ones did you want to try? I've not been particularly happy with their emulsions so far.

Seconding McCormick for the ube and pandan flavors, I only wish they weren't so expensive to purchase online. I go through lots making ice cream. McCormick is also a safe choice for more conventional flavors.

Never heard of Nature's Flavors until reading your post, but I just might give it a go for some of my more elusive flavors (sesame and pistachio).
